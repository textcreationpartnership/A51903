                  <note>The first edition of this work began publication in 1684, when a volume in Italian entitled "L'esploratore Turco" and a French version entitled "L'esplou du grand seigneur" were published in Paris by C. Barbin. Authorship is disputed, but it is generally agreed that the first fifty letters (the original four volumes) were written by Marana. In the English editions, v. 1 contains the substance of the letters commonly ascribed to Marana. The continuation (i.e. v. 2-8), said to have appeared first in English, has been variously ascribed to Robert Midgley and William Bradshaw ; Bradshaw has also been attributed as the translator (from Marana's Italian manuscripts) of the entire work under Dr. Midgley's editorship. cf. DNB; also Gentleman's magazine, 1841, p. 270.</note>

            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>TO THE READER.</head>
            <p>AT Length, after tedious Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctation, you have this long wiſh'd-for Work brought to an End. There remains no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing now, but to anſwer a few Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jections, which may be made againſt the Contents of ſome <hi>Letters</hi> in all theſe <hi>Volumes,</hi> and particularly in the Two Laſt: As alſo, to give you an Account of what this <hi>Laſt Volume</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains of Remarkable, more than was mention'd in the <hi>Preface</hi> to the <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venth:</hi> Some Things being therein omitted through Haſte and Forget<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs.</p>
            <p>As to the Objections; Some Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, more preciſe than they need to be, find Fault with our <hi>Arabian,</hi> for the ſeeming Lewdneſs of his Senti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
<pb facs="tcp:102965:4"/>and profane Expreſſions of <hi>God</hi> and his <hi>Works;</hi> ſaying, That he writes more like a <hi>Diſciple</hi> of <hi>Carneades</hi> and <hi>Epicurus,</hi> than of <hi>Mahomet;</hi> who taught his <hi>Followers</hi> to Think and Speak with profound Veneration of the <hi>God-Head,</hi> and of all <hi>Saints</hi> and <hi>Prophets.</hi> They add, That in ſome of his <hi>Letters</hi> he ſeems to Banter all <hi>Religion;</hi> whilſt in others, he appears like a <hi>Hypocrite,</hi> extravagantly Devout and Zealous, even to the Heighth of <hi>Enthuſiaſm</hi> and <hi>Divine</hi> Madneſs.</p>
            <p>In Anſwer to this; 'Tis deſir'd, That theſe Gentlemen will pleaſe to conſider, That our <hi>Author,</hi> tho a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs'd <hi>Mahometan,</hi> yet is a Man endu'd with Senſe and Reaſon, which he had much improv'd by Reading of <hi>Hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries,</hi> by the Studies of <hi>Natural, Moral,</hi> and <hi>Political</hi> Things, and by his own Experimental Obſervations in the World. That therefore, when he ſeems to deſcant with an unwarrant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Libertiniſm, profanely Glancing with a <hi>Religious</hi> Kind of Wantonneſs on <hi>Divine</hi> Matters; it ought not to be taken ſo much for his own proper direct Thoughts, as the Reſult of other
<pb facs="tcp:102965:4"/>Mens Errors, and the <hi>Epidemical Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtakes</hi> and <hi>Superſtitions</hi> which have in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected the World. So that he rather hints at what may be ſaid by Way of Inference from the Groundleſs Opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of men; than to aſſert any Thing poſitively himſelf in Diſhonour of the <hi>Deity,</hi> or True <hi>Religion.</hi> And he ban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters the <hi>Abuſes</hi> that are every where found in the <hi>Service</hi> of <hi>God,</hi> not the <hi>Service</hi> it ſelf. In a Word, he ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears, in all his Letters, a <hi>Deiſt</hi> ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther than an <hi>Atheiſt;</hi> as ſome would repreſent him. And it is well enough known, to thoſe who Travel in <hi>Tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>key,</hi> and Converſe with Men of Senſe there, That there are Abundance of <hi>Deiſts</hi> among the <hi>Mahometans,</hi> as well as among us <hi>Chriſtians:</hi> And our <hi>Ara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bian</hi> demonſtrates, that he is one of theſe, in thoſe very <hi>Letters,</hi> or Peri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ods of <hi>Letters,</hi> where they tax him with <hi>Hypocriſie</hi> and Extravagant <hi>Devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</hi> For, being as it were, abſorp'd and ſwallow'd up in the profound Contemplation of the <hi>Divine</hi> Majeſty, it is no wonder, that he breaks forth into Raptures of Love, and Extaſies of Admiration; his Thoughts being
<pb facs="tcp:102965:5"/>all over irradiated with the Incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſible and Eternal Splendors. And 'tis theſe tranſcendent Elevations of the <hi>Soul,</hi> which are the Cauſe of that Contempt and low Eſteem he ſhews toward the flat and inſipid No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and <hi>Idea</hi>'s which the Generality of Men have of the <hi>Creator</hi> of <hi>All Things.</hi> 'Tis this provokes him to mock and deride the Vanity of <hi>Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Traditions</hi> and <hi>Ceremonies,</hi> the ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diculous Pomp and Pageantry of <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal Religion,</hi> which is apt to exhauſt the Vitals of true Genuine Piety, De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votion, and Virtue.</p>
            <p>Others are, or may be offended, at his <hi>Hiſtorical Letters</hi> of the <hi>Four Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchies;</hi> alledging, that theſe are fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign to his Buſineſs, as an <hi>Agent in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cognito</hi> for the <hi>Grand Signior.</hi> The ſame Fault they find with his Deſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptions, Characters, and Hiſtories of the preſent <hi>Commonwealths</hi> in <hi>Europe:</hi> His Province being to watch the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, Counſels, and Tranſactions of the <hi>Living,</hi> and not to rehearſe the Facts and Exploits of the <hi>Dead.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In Anſwer to this; It ought to be conſider'd, That tho the Primary De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign
<pb facs="tcp:102965:5"/>of the <hi>Ottoman Port</hi> in ſending this <hi>Arabian</hi> to <hi>Paris,</hi> was, to penetrate into the <hi>Secrets</hi> of our <hi>Chriſtian Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces</hi> and <hi>States,</hi> and to return conſtant Intelligence thereof to the <hi>Divan;</hi> yet this did not hinder, but that he might hold a Correſpondence with his Private Friends in <hi>Turkey,</hi> and ſend them frequent Letters on what Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects he pleas'd, or as he thought would moſt oblige them. Much leſs cou'd he be excus'd from obeying the Orders he expreſly receiv'd from the <hi>Mufti,</hi> or any other <hi>Principal Miniſter</hi> of <hi>State,</hi> who ſhould require him, at his Hours of Leiſure, to tranſcribe either <hi>Ancient</hi> or <hi>Modern Hiſtories;</hi> or to draw Collections out of the moſt E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minent <hi>Greek</hi> and <hi>Roman Authors;</hi> knowing him to be skill'd in thoſe Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolete <hi>Languages;</hi> and that ſuch Books were rare among the <hi>Turks,</hi> by reaſon that <hi>Printing</hi> is forbid throughout the <hi>Ottoman Empire.</hi> Therefore he cou'd do no leſs, in Duty and Common Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vility, than Oblige the <hi>Mufti</hi> with an Abſtract of the <hi>Four Monarchies,</hi> which he himſelf had offer'd of his own Accord; and likewiſe gratifie
<pb facs="tcp:102965:6"/>the Expectations of <hi>Hamet</hi> the <hi>Secre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary</hi> of <hi>State,</hi> who deſir'd to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed of the <hi>Governments, Laws, Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, Cuſtoms, Manners,</hi> and <hi>Chara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cters</hi> of us <hi>Europeans;</hi> which our <hi>Ara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bian</hi> perform'd as well as he could, during his Life: And had he liv'd longer, there is no Doubt but he would have proceeded in Deſcribing <hi>England, Denmark, Swedeland, Ruſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſia, Poland, Hungary,</hi> and all the other <hi>Countries</hi> which he had not touch'd upon. But it ſeems, he was ſnatch'd away by ſome ſudden and ſurpriſing <hi>Fate,</hi> tho not altogether unforeſeen. For he all along intimates, that he had ſome Preſages of being made a <hi>Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice;</hi> eſpecially, when he heard of the ſudden Death, or Diſappearance at leaſt, of his <hi>Correſpondent, Nathan Ben Saddi,</hi> the <hi>Jew</hi> at <hi>Vienna.</hi> For then he plainly tells his Friend <hi>Oglou</hi> in a Letter, that he ſuſpected he was made a way by an Order from the <hi>Port,</hi> and that he expected to be ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved ſo himſelf in a little Time. And it is poſſible it might be ſo; it being uſual with the <hi>Turkiſh Court,</hi> thus to reward the Merits of their moſt
<pb facs="tcp:102965:6"/>faithful <hi>Miniſters,</hi> and crown all their Services with <hi>Martyrdom</hi> to the <hi>State.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>As to what this laſt <hi>Volume</hi> contains more than was expreſs'd in the <hi>Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face</hi> to the <hi>Seventh.</hi> Here you have an Account of the horrid <hi>Poyſoning</hi> Trade that was practis'd in <hi>France,</hi> in the Year 1681 and 1682; as alſo ſome Remarks on our <hi>Popiſh Plot;</hi> on the Great <hi>Comet</hi> that appear'd about that Time; with a particular Abſtract of the <hi>Life,</hi> and an Account of the Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barous Murder of Dr. <hi>Sharp,</hi> Arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biſhop of St. <hi>Andrews,</hi> and <hi>Primate</hi> of <hi>Scotland.</hi> He alſo touches upon the <hi>Perſecution</hi> of the <hi>Huguenots</hi> in <hi>France.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But that which ought to be moſt taken notice of, is, a Letter of his to <hi>Nathan Ben Saddi;</hi> wherein he highly extols the <hi>Journal</hi> of <hi>Carcoa, Nathan's Predeceſſor</hi> in that <hi>Poſt:</hi> Which <hi>Jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal,</hi> the Tranſlator of theſe <hi>Volumes</hi> underſtanding to be in the Hands of the <hi>Italian</hi> who firſt found our <hi>Arabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an</hi>'s Papers, and with whom he has ſince contracted a Correſpondence; he has endeavour'd to prevail with him
<pb facs="tcp:102965:7"/>to communicate it to the Publiſher hereof. Wherein if he ſhall be ſo Happy as to ſucceed, he will in due Time tranſmit it to the World in our <hi>Mother-Tongue,</hi> to the Satisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction and Benefit of the Publick.</p>

                  <p>WHether it be an Effect of thy Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancholy Letter, or of my own ugly Conſtitution, I know not; but I am lately grown very Deſperate, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolv'd upon <hi>Death.</hi> I am tir'd with whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:102965:14"/>I have yet enjoy'd in this World; and I expect no greater ſatisfaction, ſhould I live a Thouſand Years. Every Pleaſure ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears but the ſame in different Forms; and they all agree, in leaving us afflicted with the ſame or greater Pain than they found us in: Which is a ſufficient Argument to a <hi>Man of Spirit,</hi> that he ought to die, in purſuit of his own Eaſe.</p>
                  <p>We walk here on Earth in an Enchanted Circle of Shadows and Mockeries: Our whole Life is full of Vanity and Miſtake. E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very Man's Fortune is but a Repetition of <hi>Ixion</hi>'s: We court <hi>Clouds</hi> inſtead of <hi>Divini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties;</hi> and our moſt charming Fruitions conſiſt in Emptineſs.</p>
                  <p>Indeed, all this Viſible World is but a Mighty <hi>Pageant,</hi> a Pompous <hi>Emblem,</hi> a Gaudy <hi>Type</hi> of that <hi>Inviſible Region</hi> which is the <hi>Mother of Spirits.</hi> Oh! that it were law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful for a Mortal, to releaſe his <hi>Soul</hi> from its long irkſom Exile here Below, and ſend it Home to its Native Country, the <hi>Kingdom</hi> of <hi>Divine Ideas!</hi> Then wou'd I ſoon launch forth into the unknown Abyſs. But we muſt be reſign'd, and not think much to bear our ſeveral <hi>Deſtinies;</hi> and patiently wait for the appointed Hour of <hi>Tranſmigration:</hi> For it is in vain to think of haſtning or delaying our <hi>Fate.</hi> Beſides, for ought we know, the <hi>next</hi> Station may be worſe than <hi>this:</hi> Every thing is full of Myſterious Darkneſs. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, prithee <hi>Mehemet,</hi> let thou and I lay a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide all fruitleſs Care and Sadneſs; be as
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:102965:14"/>merry as will conſiſt with the Wiſdom of a Man; and when thou findeſt this black Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtemper approaching thee, run away from it, and ſhelter thy ſelf in good Company. Arm thy ſelf with <hi>Wine</hi> and <hi>Muſick</hi> againſt the ſullen <hi>Daemon</hi> of <hi>Melancholy.</hi> But I coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel thee, to avoid <hi>Women,</hi> for they'l but en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe thy <hi>Malady.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>'Tis one of that <hi>Sex</hi> has given me this fit of Grief, a <hi>Woman</hi> that I have loved too much: But ſhe's Ingrateful, Falſe and Cruel; ſhe takes a ſingular delight in cheating me with falſe ſhews of Love and Friendſhip; and then in undeceiving me again. The ſame Tongue which at ſome times will drop ſoft kind obliging Words, at another Seaſon ſhall utter nothing but Contempts, Defiances and Scorns.</p>
                  <p>Thou wilt wonder that a Man of my Age ſhould be concern'd with any Paſſion for <hi>Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men.</hi> I tell thee, <hi>My Friend,</hi> it is impoſſible for me to baniſh from my Heart, and Affection which has poſſeſſed it for above theſe Thirty Years. The Love of <hi>that Sex</hi> is riveted in our Nature, and our Blood muſt firſt grow Cold and be congeal'd by <hi>Death,</hi> before this Flame can be extinguiſh'd: Nay, many times it is more fervent, though of a ſhort dura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in our Lateſt Hours than in our <hi>Prime.</hi> As when the Oyl which feeds a Lamp is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt ſpent, the ſtartled Flame begins to rouze it ſelf, and burn afreſh, as if 'twou'd fain ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt a little longer, tho on the very Dregs of its accuſtomed Fuel; it crackles and flaſhes
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:102965:15"/>with greater Noiſe and Luſtre than before; but preſently expires. So does this <hi>Amorous Fire,</hi> when we are neareſt to our Diſſolution, begin to trouble us moſt, and makes our <hi>Soul</hi> to blaze with <hi>Fevers</hi> of <hi>Deſire</hi> and <hi>Grief,</hi> knowing its Period is near.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Mehemet,</hi> Let thou and I keep our Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections for the Beautiful and Conſtant <hi>Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters</hi> of <hi>Paradiſe,</hi> who will never caſt an Eye on any Man beſide their own.

                  <p>THis has been a Terrible Campagne to the <hi>Germans</hi> and their <hi>Confederates:</hi> For when they firſt took the Field in the <hi>Spring,</hi> their Forces amounted to Sixty Thouſand Men, but now at the breaking up, and going to their <hi>Winter</hi> Quarters, they could not number above Twenty Thouſand. So that they have loſt Two Parts in Three of their Army. Whilſt the <hi>French</hi> proſper and are victorious; taking their Towns and Caſtles, ſubduing whole Provinces to the Obedience
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:102965:15"/>of this <hi>Invincible Monarch,</hi> and extending his Conqueſts far and wide through the <hi>Franche-Comptè, Lorrain, Alſace, Brabant, Flanders, Catalonia,</hi> and even to the <hi>Iſles</hi> of the <hi>Sea.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I have formerly given an Account to the <hi>Miniſters</hi> of the <hi>Port,</hi> of all the moſt Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable Actions perform'd in theſe ſeveral Quarters; there remains only a late famous Victory gain'd by the <hi>Mareſchal de Turenne,</hi> near <hi>Strasbourg,</hi> of which I cannot give thee the Particulars, neither is it very Material. But, in brief I ſhall acquaint thee, that through the Connivance of the <hi>Elector</hi> of <hi>Mayence,</hi> and the Citizens of <hi>Strasbourg,</hi> the <hi>Confede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate</hi> Forces, amounting to Forty Thouſand Men, got paſſage over the <hi>Rhine,</hi> and had like to have ſurpriz'd the <hi>French,</hi> who were not above Twenty Five Thouſand ſtrong. But the Vigilance and good Conduct of <hi>Monſieur Turenne,</hi> prevented their Deſign, and turn'd the Fortune of War to his own ſide. This <hi>Wiſe General</hi> conſidering the unequal Numbers of his Enemies, did not think it fit to engage his whole Army at once with theirs, leſt he ſhould be oppreſſed with their Multitude, being almoſt double in number to his. But he fought them by Detachments, ſetting upon them in their March: And this ſucceeded very fortunately, for he was in poſſeſſion of the moſt advantagious Poſts and Paſſes of the Country. He lined the Hedges with ſome of his Men, who gall'd the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies as they marched along the Roads. He planted others on the <hi>Declive</hi> of Hills, under
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:102965:16"/>the Covert of Thickets which grew on each ſide of deep Ways, through which the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my muſt paſs; theſe annoy'd them ſorely from their ſhady Heights, whilſt ſome at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tack'd them in the Front. Thus by gradual Skirmiſhes, he cut off many Thouſands, and ſtraw'd the Roads with Dead Bodies: 'Till the Confederates perceiving how they were embaraſs'd on all Hands, took the Advantage of a certain Wood, where they retrench'd themſelves, and ſtood in their own defence a long time. But the <hi>French</hi> at length forc'd them from this ſhelter, and then began a formal Battel, which prov'd bloody to the <hi>Imperialiſts:</hi> For they had above Three Thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand of their Men killed upon the Spot, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides thoſe that were wounded and taken Priſoners. They loſt alſo Ten Pieces of their Cannon, and the Ground was cover'd with <hi>Cuiraſſes, Halberds, Pikes, Muskets, Swords,</hi> and all ſorts of Arms, which the Confederates left behind in their precipitate Retreat by Night. For ſo general a Conſternation had ſeiz'd the Minds of the Souldiery, that all the Rhetorick of the Officers was not ſufficient to ſtop their Flight.

                  <p>NOW I will indulge ſacred Thoughts, and follow the Motions of Wiſdom; I will obey the Inſpirations of my better <hi>Genius,</hi> and diſcourſe of things not ſit for Vulgar Ears. I will not caſt my <hi>Holy</hi> things to <hi>Dogs,</hi> nor expoſe that which is precious to the <hi>Feet</hi> of <hi>Swine.</hi> Let the <hi>Smith</hi> labour at his Anvil, and Hammer the Mettal into what Form he
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:102965:17"/>pleaſes; his Eye is waſted with the perpetual Vapour of the Fire; and as to Intellectual things, he is ſtark Blind. So is the <hi>Carpenter</hi> who works in Timber, and hews away the Knobs and Roughneſſes with his Axe; he ſaws it into Planks, and afterwards ſmooths it with his Plane; he marks out his Work with <hi>Line</hi> and <hi>Plummet,</hi> and meaſures it with <hi>Rule</hi> and <hi>Compaſs;</hi> he fits one Piece to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and when all is poliſh'd and prepar'd to his Mind, he joyns them together in a Frame, and rejoyces in the ſucceſs of his In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duſtry and Skill.</p>
                  <p>Theſe and all other Mechanicks bend their Mind to their Work; that is the ſcope of their Ambition; and when they have done, they eat and drink the fruit of their Labours. They ſtudy not the <hi>Sayings</hi> of <hi>Famous Men,</hi> nor penetrate into the <hi>Miſteries</hi> of <hi>Dark Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rables;</hi> they have no Inclination to ſeek out the <hi>wiſdom</hi> of the <hi>Ancients,</hi> or to meditate on the <hi>Inſtructions</hi> of <hi>Sages.</hi> Therefore with ſuch as theſe I will not converſe, or talk of the way of <hi>Perfection:</hi> Nor yet with <hi>Wreſtlers, Fencers</hi> or <hi>Soldiers:</hi> I have as little hopes to prevail on <hi>Mariners, Lawyers</hi> and <hi>Courtiers,</hi> or on any that are entangled in Worldly Affairs. But I addreſs my ſelf to a Good and know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Man, who underſtands himſelf, and what his Buſineſs is in this World; who compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hends the force of the Chains which intangle his <hi>Soul</hi> in this Mortal Life, and is inſtructed in the Method of diſingaging himſelf. To ſuch an one I ſpeak, and not to others, who
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:102965:17"/>lye ſnoring in their <hi>Lethargy,</hi> and will not be wak'd.</p>
                  <p>Certainly 'tis as impoſſible, that one and the ſame Rule of Life, ſhould fit the various Tempers and Conditions of Men, as that one and the ſame courſe ſhould be taken, effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctually to diſpoſe a Man to Sleep, and vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lently to keep him Awake. For he that would ſleep out his whole Life, if any be ſo ſottiſh, it behoves him to procure a conſtant ſupply of things which create Sleep. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as he that deſigns to be Vigilant and Active, muſt furniſh himſelf with ſuch things as chaſe away Sleep, and incline to Watchfulneſs. The former therefore ought to give himſelf up to <hi>Gluttony, Drunkenneſs</hi> and <hi>Surfeiting:</hi> He ſhould have a dark Houſe, a ſoft and large Bed: And ſhould uſe all manner of Appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations that cauſe Drowſineſs; as Soporife<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous Perfumes, Potions, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Whereas the latter ought to be always Sober, to Drink moderately, and Eat a ſlender Diet; to have a light Houſe, a ſerene Air a ſenſe of Pain, a ſtreight and hard Bed, little ſitted for Mans Repoſe.</p>
                  <p>But whether we Mortals are in a Place where we ought perpetually to be upon our Watch; or whether our whole Life ought to be but one Night of Sleep, is known only to ſuch as thee, who haſt diſcover'd the Preſtigious <hi>Magick</hi> of the <hi>Body,</hi> and how the Soul is enchanted in this World; who haſt found out the Native Activity of the <hi>Mind,</hi> and how it comes to be <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>tupified by the
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:102965:18"/>hidden <hi>Opiates</hi> that lie lurking in the Fleſh.</p>
                  <p>Holy <hi>Santone,</hi> whilſt we are in this World of Shadows, we are perfect Exiles, baniſh'd from our Native Country, which is the World of <hi>Real Subſtances:</hi> The more we are drench'd in <hi>Matter,</hi> the farther do we ſtraggle from Home, wandring in foreign Deſarts of Enchanted Ground, where we converſe with none but empty <hi>Spectres, Fairies, Daemons, Elfs,</hi> and cheating Apparitions. For all that's in this Outward World, is but a falſe Delu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, the <hi>Mimickry</hi> of <hi>Nature;</hi> a heap of Sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dows revers'd and tinctur'd with a faint Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection from the <hi>World</hi> of <hi>Light.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Knowing therefore theſe things, let us make haſte to return to our Native Seats again; let us diveſt our ſelves of the ſtrange Habits we have taken up by Imitation in this our Pilgrimage, and Purge our Minds of all the Ill Qualities we have Imbib'd on Earth: Let us caſt off corrupt Affections, Appetites and Inclinations, with every vain and falſe Opinion. When we are free'd from all theſe Weights, our <hi>Souls</hi> will eaſily mount aloft, their Wings never flagging, 'till they perch upon the Trees of <hi>Paradiſe.</hi> What is more Generous than the <hi>Mind</hi> of Man, when once awaken'd from the Slumbers of this Mortal Life? How it deſpiſes theſe <hi>Terrene</hi> Enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and only pants and thirſts for the Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pream Delights <hi>Above!</hi> As Iron turns it ſelf, and makes its Amorous Approaches to the <hi>Magnet;</hi> ſo is the Soul attracted by the O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riginal Eſſence which is its Source and Center.</p>
                  <pb n="11" facs="tcp:102965:18"/>
                  <p>There are <hi>Two Species</hi> of Chains which tye the <hi>Soul</hi> down to this Earth, and cauſe her to grow dull and torpid, as if ſhe were inebriated with deadly Poiſon, forgetting her very Native Faculty of <hi>Contemplation.</hi> Theſe are <hi>Pleaſure</hi> and <hi>Pain,</hi> of which our Senſe is the Author, with the Prepoſſeſſions, Phan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taſies, Opinions, Memories and Appetites which accompany our Senſe. Theſe hurry and precipitate the <hi>Soul</hi> down from her proper Manſion, and alienate her from the Love of the only true Subſtantial <hi>Being:</hi> Therefore we ought to abſtain from Senſible Things as much as in us lies; and ſhun all Objects that ſtir up Irregular Appetites, and produce Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurdities in our Reaſon.</p>
                  <p>How many ſtrange Affections flow from our Taſte, binding faſt the Soul with a double Cord; whilſt the high Reliſh and Guſt of Savoury Meats, enſnare her in the Palate as in a Net. and the load of indigeſted Crudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties weighs and ſinks her down into the Belly, where ſhe's kept as in a Dungeon, till Sacred Abſtinence releaſes her again?</p>
                  <p>The Senſe of <hi>Touch</hi> does often draw the Unwary <hi>Soul</hi> forth from her Faſtneſſes with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in, trepanning her with ſoft Allurements and ſly Promiſes of Pleaſure to take the Air o'th' Body. Thus having got her into the open Field, an Ambuſcade of Luſts, Concupi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcences, Perturbations, Fears, Cares, Love, Joy, Grief, and other Paſſions ruſh upon her on a ſudden, and take her Captive. How neceſſary therefore is it to be always on our
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:102965:19"/>Guard, and not to lull our ſelves in dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous Security? Nor ought we to be raſh and fool-hardy, in venturing on a Combat; where 'tis better to decline it, leſt inſtead of victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, we betray the weakneſs of our Arms, and Want of Proper Conduct.</p>
                  <p>O <hi>Perfect Man!</hi> Thou ſeeſt theſe things in clearer Light than I; 'tis not to inform thee, that I write, but to confirm my ſelf, whilſt I collect my ſcatter'd Thoughts and put 'em into Order. If thou ſhalt vouchſafe to ſend me thy Conceptions on this Subject, I will revere the bleſſed <hi>Diſpatch,</hi> as tho it were an <hi>Oracle.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>In the mean while, may <hi>Heaven</hi> regard thy Innocent Life, and ſtill protect thee from the Caſualties that threaten all of Mortal Race. May thy Prayers be heard, and thy <hi>Good Works rewarded.</hi> Finally, may thy End be like that of <hi>Enoch,</hi> who never ſaw <hi>Death,</hi> but was tranſlated alive to <hi>Paradiſe.</hi>

                     <hi>To</hi> Ali, Baſſa.</head>
                  <p>IT is evident, That <hi>the French Arms are deſtin'd not to ruſt:</hi> One Provocation or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther always keeps them in Action. The Neighbouring <hi>Princes</hi> and <hi>States</hi> take their Turns to affront and injure this <hi>Monarch,</hi> and ſometimes they ſet upon him all together. Surely, they Envy and Fear the riſing Fortune of <hi>France,</hi> and therefore ſtrive by Stratagems and Force to check its Growth.</p>
                  <p>There having been ſeveral Acts of Hoſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity done by the <hi>Governour</hi> of the <hi>Spaniſh Netherlands,</hi> without any Hopes of a fair Redreſs, <hi>this King</hi> found himſelf oblig'd to declare open War againſt <hi>Spain.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This was done very lately, and at the ſame time the <hi>Duke de Navailles</hi> was ſent with an Army into <hi>Flanders;</hi> where he ſoon took the Town and Caſtle of <hi>Aubeſpine;</hi> the Towns of <hi>Peſme</hi> and <hi>Mornais;</hi> the Caſtle of <hi>Oigny,</hi> with the Towns of <hi>Gray</hi> and <hi>Vezont.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This laſt is a Place of conſiderable Impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, being called the <hi>Gate of Lorrain,</hi> and the Poſtern of the <hi>Franche Comté.</hi> Whereby this <hi>Monarch</hi> is become actual Maſter of the <hi>Baillage</hi> of <hi>Amont,</hi> which comprehends a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove Five Hundred Villages.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Spaniards</hi> ſeeing him thus Succeſsful, and that they could not by open Reſiſtance
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:102965:20"/>ſtop the courſe of his Victories, took another Method, and ſought to undermine him by Plots, and Confederacies with ſome of his Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects.</p>
                  <p>They had agreed with the <hi>Chevalier de Rohan,</hi> to ſettle on him a Penſion of Eight Thouſand Livres a Year, and to preſent him out of Hand, with Five Thouſand Piſtoles, if he would put them in Poſſeſſion of <hi>Quil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lebeuf,</hi> a ſtrong Place in the Province of <hi>Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandy.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The <hi>Chevalier de Rohan</hi> had made himſelf and them believe, that it was in his Power with much Eaſe to perform this: But he was miſtaken. Some of his Friends ſay, he never thought of accompliſhing his Bargain, his Credit being too ſmall in that Place; and that he only aim'd to repair his Fortune, by cheating the <hi>Spaniards</hi> of their Five Thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand Piſtoles. However, the Plot was diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover'd to the <hi>French King,</hi> who has his Spies in all Corners of the Kingdom. The un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunate <hi>Chevalier</hi> was ſeiz'd, and brought to the <hi>Baſtille,</hi> and being convicted of Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, was condemn'd to loſe his Head, which was accordingly Executed.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Marquis</hi> of <hi>Villars,</hi> and the <hi>Sieur de Pereau,</hi> ſuffer'd the ſame Puniſhment, as Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>complices in the Treaſon. Another <hi>French Lord</hi> of the Party, was Kill'd in defending himſelf againſt thoſe who were order'd to ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt him. Theſe had undertaken to deliver other Places of Strength into the Hands of the <hi>Hollanders</hi> who firſt begun the War.</p>
                  <pb n="15" facs="tcp:102965:20"/>
                  <p>Had their Conſpiracy taken Effect, it would have been no difficult matter to corrupt other <hi>Grandees</hi> with the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Gold, and ſo a Third Part of <hi>France</hi> might have been ſold for a Price not allowable in the <hi>Mereats</hi> of <hi>Kings.</hi> For it ſeems the <hi>Hollanders</hi> and <hi>Spaniards,</hi> were upon the Point of making their Deſcents in <hi>Normandy</hi> and <hi>Bretagne,</hi> being invited thereto by the large Promiſes of the Perſons before-named, and their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>federates, who made them believe, that a great Part of the Nobility and Gentry of thoſe Provinces wou'd come over to them, as ſoon as they ſaw them Landed; and there was no need to fear any oppoſition from the Vulgar, who are bound to follow the Fortune of their Lords. Beſides they are always de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſirous of Novelty and Change.</p>
                  <p>There is nothing ſo Abject, Poor and Contemptible, as the Peaſantry of <hi>France,</hi> who labour only for others, whilſt they can hardly get Bread for themſelves out of all their Toil. In a word, they are abſolute Slaves to them whoſe Tenants they are, and whoſe Lands they farm. They are not more oppreſſed by the Publick Taxes and <hi>Gabels,</hi> than they are by the Private Impoſitions of their Country Lords, beſide the unreaſonable Demands of the <hi>Prieſts.</hi> Theſe Sufferings diſpoſe them to wiſh for any Revolution in the Government, from which they might hope to receive gentler Uſage.</p>
                  <p>'Twas this partly which encourag'd the <hi>Hollanders</hi> and <hi>Spaniards</hi> to think of invading
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:102965:21"/>
                     <hi>France:</hi> Otherwiſe, they had only been upon the Defenſive. This King has to do with a great many Potent Enemies. The <hi>Emperor</hi> holds him play on the <hi>Rhine;</hi> the <hi>Duke</hi> of <hi>Lorrain</hi> gives him Diverſion in his New Conqueſts on that ſide. The <hi>King</hi> of <hi>Spain</hi> puts him to a great Expence of Men and Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny in <hi>Flanders.</hi> The <hi>Hollanders</hi> infeſt him by Sea, and would do by Land, if they knew which way. Yet this <hi>Monarch</hi> copes with 'em all; baffles their Plots and Intrigues, foils their Arms, daily gains Ground; and by a continued Series of Conqueſts, makes it apparent, that <hi>his</hi> is the only flouriſhing Fortune in the <hi>Weſt.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The <hi>King</hi> of <hi>Sweden</hi> had made certain Propoſals of Peace between the <hi>Emperor,</hi> the <hi>King</hi> of <hi>France,</hi> the <hi>King</hi> of <hi>Spain,</hi> the <hi>States</hi> of <hi>Holland,</hi> and ſome of the <hi>Electoral Princes.</hi> In order to which, he offer'd himſelf to become a Mediator between them. He ſent his Embaſſadors accordingly, to a Place agreed upon by all Parties, as the moſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient for Conferences of this Nature. So did all the other Princes and States concern'd in the Wat. But it ſeems there was a groſs Affront put upon <hi>Guillaume de Furſtemberg,</hi> Plenipotentiary to the <hi>Elector</hi> of <hi>Cologne,</hi> by the <hi>Marquis de Grana,</hi> Embaſſador to the <hi>Emperor.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This was deeply reſented at the <hi>French</hi> Court, as being a Notorious Breach of the Law of Nations; and the <hi>King</hi> publiſhed a <hi>Manifeſto,</hi> wherein he charg'd the <hi>Emperor</hi>
                     <pb n="17" facs="tcp:102965:21"/>with giving Order for this Inſult; declaring alſo, that unleſs due Satisfaction were made, he would withdraw his Embaſſadors from the Place of Conference, and ſeek Juſtice with Sword in Hand.</p>
                  <p>He complain'd to the <hi>King</hi> of <hi>Swedeland</hi> of this Violence, and enter'd into a cloſe and ſtrict League with him. <hi>Guſtavus</hi> preſently recalls his Embaſſadors from the publick Meeting, commanding them to proteſt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Action of the <hi>Marquis de Grana,</hi> as a Violation of the Civil Laws. The <hi>French King</hi> has done the ſame, and all Things ſeem to portend a general Diſtraction in <hi>Europe.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thoſe of the <hi>Roman Church</hi> fight againſt one another, as well as they combine againſt the <hi>Proteſtants,</hi> whom they eſteem as the Common Enemy, and have little beter Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard for them, than we <hi>Moſelmans</hi> have for the <hi>Perſian Kyſilbaſchi,</hi> whom we execrate as abominable Hereticks. One ſort of <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants</hi> alſo cabal againſt another; the <hi>Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therans</hi> hate and perſecute the <hi>Calvaniſts;</hi> which the Latter return with equal Animo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity. Theſe Infidels are caught in the Devil's Snare, where they bite and devour one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. They are in egregious Darkneſs, toſs'd about in the Tempeſt of Errors. They are ſurrounded with Enchantments: Their Guides are Sorcerers and Magicians: <hi>Hell</hi> has a Hand in all their Devices.</p>
                  <p>O ye <hi>True Believers,</hi> lift up your Heads! For the Hour is approaching, wherein the
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:102965:22"/>Ancient Prophecies muſt be fulfilled; That <hi>the Dragon of the Eaſt, ſhall wage War with the Eagle of the Weſt, and ſhall devour him Whole with all his Feathers.</hi> Woe be to thee O <hi>Land</hi> of <hi>Japhet,</hi> in the Year 1700 of the Chriſtians Style.</p>

                  </p>
                  <p>Surely, there is no <hi>Species</hi> of Four-footed Beaſts, of Birds, of Fiſh, of Inſects, Reptiles or any other living Things, whoſe Nature is not found in Man. How exactly agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to the <hi>Fox</hi> are ſome Mens Tempers? Whilſt others are perfect <hi>Bears</hi> in Human
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:102965:23"/>Shape. Here you ſhall meet a <hi>Crocodile,</hi> who ſeeks with feigned Tears to entrap you to your Ruin: There a ſly <hi>Serpent</hi> creeps and winds himſelf into your Affections; and when he is well-warm'd with Favours, on a ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den he will bite and ſting you to Death. <hi>Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers, Lions, Leopards, Panthers, Wolves,</hi> and all the Monſtrous Generations of <hi>Africk,</hi> may be ſeen Maſquerading in the Forms of Men. And 'tis not hard for an obſerving Mind to ſee their Natural Complexion, through the borrow'd Vizard. The <hi>Phyſiog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomy</hi> of Vice and Vertue, are eaſily diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh'd. There are ſome ſecret Characters in every Face, which ſpeak the Nature of the Perſon. So does <hi>Platonick</hi> Love, with Eagle Eyes ſoon trace the Signatures of what is Amiable in the <hi>Soul.</hi> We read the hidden Qualities of Men at the firſt Glance; and hence are laſting Friendſhips often contract<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. I love my Friends without Reſerve; and becauſe thoſe are very few among our Mortal Race, I contract Familiarities with the Harmleſs <hi>Animals:</hi> I ſtudy like a Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver to oblige and win their Hearts, by all the tender Offices I can perform. I bear with Patience their wild froward Tricks, till conſtant Perſeverance vanquiſhes their ſtubborn Humours: Then when we once begin to underſtand each other aright, they make me a Thouſand ſweet Returns of Gratitude according to their Kind. When I am Melancholy, they'll ſoon divert me with
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:102965:23"/>one pretty Trick or other, as if they were ſenſible of my Pain.</p>
                  <p>But becauſe my Love is large and ſtrong, ſtill ſeeking to dilate it ſelf, though ſtill re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coyling from the degenerate Race of Men; I go into the Fields and Woods, and make my ſilent Court unto the Trees and Flowers, and ſometimes I converſe in Raillery with Eccho's. I languiſh on the Banks of Chry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtal Streams, and pine away for an old Moſſy Rock. The Oak enflames me with a Sacred Paſſion, when I behold her Vene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable Bulk and Shade. I could almoſt turn <hi>Druid</hi> for her ſake, and take my Reſidence up for ever in her hollow Trunk; where the Kind <hi>Genii</hi> of the Air wou'd viſit me, and tell me Things to come, inſtructing me in all the Myſteries of <hi>Nature;</hi> for I'm in Love ev'n with thoſe <hi>Inviſible Beings;</hi> and often tell my Paſſion to 'em in the Woods, or on ſome Mountain, where the Courteous Winds tranſport my Words, and waft their ſecret Anſwers back again. Then is my <hi>Soul</hi> ſnatch'd up in Sacred Ecſtaſies, becauſe th'Immortals condeſcend to talk with me. I often fall into a Trance, and wake not till the <hi>Sun</hi> is got half way into t'other <hi>Hemiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phere.</hi> Then I reſolve to paſs away the Night in this ſweet Solitude.</p>
                  <p>Had I the Tongues, or Pens of <hi>Cicero</hi> and <hi>Demoſthenes,</hi> I could not to the Life expreſs the Pleaſures that I feel at ſuch a Time, when free and undiſturb'd I can for ſeveral Hours behold the Motions of the <hi>Moon</hi> and
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:102965:24"/>
                     <hi>Stars.</hi> Oh <hi>God!</hi> What Thoughts, what Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>templations riſe within my Breaſt? My Raviſh'd <hi>Soul</hi> is ready to break Priſon for Joy, when 'tis inſpir'd with certain Demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrations of the World's Etérnity. Methinks at ſuch a Time, I hear the Noiſe and Buſtle of the Worlds Above: Methinks I ſee the Active, Buſie Tenants of the <hi>Moon</hi> and <hi>Stars,</hi> trudging about their daily Buſineſs, even like us Mortals here Below. Then 'tis I nauſeate the narrow Principles of Ignorant, Superſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious Men; I hate to think of e'er returning to the City again, there to prophane my Reaſon with the vain Diſcourſe of Self-con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceited Fools and Idiots. I am cloy'd with Life, and wiſh to die amidſt theſe charming Speculations. Thus do I paſs the Time a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way, till fair <hi>Aurora</hi> uſhers in the Roſy-fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger'd Morn. Then I begin to reflect on my Duty as a <hi>Moſelman,</hi> and Slave to the <hi>Grand Signior.</hi> I haſte to waſh my ſelf in the next Stream, and chearfully proſtrate my ſelf up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Ground, adoring the <hi>Eternal Source</hi> of <hi>all Things.</hi> After which, abundantly ſatisfied with theſe Nocturnal Pleaſures, I return to the City and to my Buſineſs; conſidering, That I were not wholly born for Contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plation.</p>
                  <p>Learned <hi>Hali,</hi> I wiſh thee conſummate Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs in this Life, and fortunate <hi>Tranſmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grations</hi> after Death; praying alſo, that I may merit one Day to enjoy thy Company in <hi>Paradiſe,</hi> where we may diſcourſe theſe
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:102965:24"/>Things more at large, and in a clearer Light than what this Earth affords. Adieu.</p>

                     <hi>To</hi> Kerker Haſſan, Baſſa.</head>
                  <p>TO what Purpoſe am I kept longer in <hi>Paris?</hi> Why do the <hi>Miniſters</hi> of the <hi>Port,</hi> put the <hi>Grand Signior</hi> to a needleſs Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence, in maintaining here an Old Superan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuated Slave, not worth his daily Bread? And yet, <hi>God</hi> knows, I eat not much, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther can I taſte any Pleaſure in that little I eat. My Refections are like the Entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of Magical Tables, where the Eye is deluded with a fair ſhew of various De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licacies, but the Stomach is not ſatisfied with any real Food, nor the Body ſtrengthened by any ſubſtantial Nouriſhment. Only the lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhing Imagination feeds on Phantaſtick Diſhes, mere Shadows, and Enchanted Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemblances of Solid Meat; while the Man is ready to faint for Hunger. So I ſeem to my ſelf to Eat and Drink, but 'tis with ſo little guſt at preſent, and I receive ſo little benefit from it afterwards, that all appears no more than a Viſionary Feaſt, or a Colla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in a Dream.</p>
                  <pb n="24" facs="tcp:102965:25"/>
                  <p>I have now paſs'd the <hi>Grand Climacter</hi> of Human Life, being enter'd into the Sixty Fourth Year of my Age. My Senſes droop, and all the Faculties of my <hi>Soul</hi> and <hi>Body</hi> decay apace. My Bones are weary of ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porting their accuſtomed Burden. My <hi>Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>new;</hi> and <hi>Muſcles</hi> refuſe to perform the Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of Motion, at leaſt their Vigor is much ſlacken'd and impair'd. In a Word, the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmities of my Body have rank'd me under a new <hi>Predicament;</hi> I am become a <hi>Three<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>footed Animal,</hi> being forced to walk with a Staff, to prevent the neceſſity of Metamor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phoſing my Hands to Feet, and crawling on all Four.</p>
                  <p>Judge now, <hi>Illuſtrious Arab,</hi> after what I have ſaid, whether I am fitting to do the <hi>Grand Signior</hi> ſervice in this Station. As for the Intrigues of the Court, I am quite tyr'd of them. Beſides here are now no more <hi>Richlieu</hi>'s and <hi>Mazarini</hi>'s in Being, with whom I might inſinuate on the ſcore of Skill in tranſlating <hi>Greek, Sclavonick, Arabick,</hi> and other Eaſtern Languages. <hi>Oſmin</hi> the Dwarf is alſo Dead, from whom I us'd to learn ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Secrets. <hi>Fate</hi> has alſo ſnatch'd away ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral <hi>Courtiers</hi> with whom I had intimate Converſe. Add to this, that <hi>Eliachim</hi> grows Old and Crazy, who was once as my Right Hand: So prompt and dextrous in any Bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs of Difficulty; Faithful alſo as my own Heart, which never was tainted with the leaſt Symptom of Diſloyalty. So that all things conſider'd, I cannot ſee what the
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:102965:25"/>Sublime Miniſters can propoſe in retaining me at <hi>Paris.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I do not deſire as formerly, to travel into <hi>India,</hi> or any other Region of the Eaſt: I do not ſo much as Covet to ſee my own Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Country, for which I have had ſuch paſſionate Longings. No, every Place will be <hi>Arabia</hi> to me, where I may reſt from Buſineſſes of State, and ſhut up my latter Days in Quietneſs. It is Time for me to bid Adieu to the Active Life, and betake my ſelf wholly to <hi>Contemplation.</hi> I would fain abandon not only the actual Vanities of this fading World, but the very remembrance and thoughts of them. My Mind is nau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeated with the Idea's of paſt Folly, which Men falſly call <hi>Pleaſure:</hi> And I find no guſt in any thing but the Meditation of <hi>Death,</hi> and the unknown State of departed <hi>Souls.</hi> All other Things are uncertain Toys, and empty Trifles. But that great change, which no Mortal hath ever yet eſcap'd, is ſtable, permanent, and fix'd by <hi>Deſtiny.</hi> Fate has ſet the Period, which winds up the <hi>Epocha</hi> of every Mans Life in this viſible State, and begins a new <hi>Hejira,</hi> whereof we have no Computation; in regard we have no Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſpondence with that unknown World: Neither are there any certain Hiſtories ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant, which can rightly inform us. The Flight of the <hi>Soul</hi> from the <hi>Body</hi> begins the Myſterious Date; but where or when it will end, is not known to us that ſtay behind. This therefore alone is worthy of an Old
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:102965:26"/>Man's Thoughts, how to prepare himſelf for <hi>Death,</hi> ſince he cannot protract the Term of his Life, beyond the Moment allotted by <hi>Heaven.</hi> Neither can he be aſſur'd what will become of him afterwards.</p>
                  <p>Think not, <hi>Serene Baſſa,</hi> that I am going to lay a Train for the Reputation of a Saint, or wou'd ſet up all on a ſudden for an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary Pious Man. No, there's nothing of that in't. I hate the rigid Hypocriſie of forc'd Penance; and the Religious Lunacy of thoſe, who never think they do enough to atone for their Sins, unleſs they outdo Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manity it ſelf in their cruel Mortifications. Theſe are Monſters in all good <hi>Divinity,</hi> and their Example is not to be followed.</p>
                  <p>What I aim at in this Diſcourſe is, That as according to the Order of Nature, and Will of Deſtiny, we are born Men, ſo we ſhould take care to <hi>Live</hi> and <hi>Die.</hi> And if we have ſuffer'd the former part of our Life to elapſe without due Reflection on ſo impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant a Truth; 'tis but Reaſon, that when we approach near the Grave; when all our Senſes, Faculties and Members do the part of <hi>King Philip</hi>'s Page, putting us <hi>daily</hi> and <hi>hourly in Mind of our Mortality:</hi> 'Tis but Reaſon, I ſay, that then we ſhould begin to recollect our ſelves, and to think wherea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouts we are; that we may not be ſurprized by the Inevitable Decree of Fate, when it comes to be put in Execution; nor die leſs than our ſelves.</p>
                  <pb n="27" facs="tcp:102965:26"/>
                  <p>Beſides there is another advantage in be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thus prepar'd for the laſt things; ſince it equally arms us againſt all intermediate Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lamities, ſuppoſing we ſhou'd live longer than we reckon. He that can boldly ſtare Death in the Face, will not eaſily turn his Back upon any Misfortune of this Inconſtant Life. But receiving all things with an even Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, renders himſelf happy in the midſt of Troubles, Loſſes, Diſgraces, Pains, Sickneſſes, and other Caſualties which aſſault all that live on Earth.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Magnificent Baſſa,</hi> all that I have ſaid, is but a Prologue to my main purpoſe, which is to deſire thy Mediation with the Firſt <hi>Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zier,</hi> that I may be recall'd from an Employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment wherein I cannot be ſo ſerviceable as I have been; and which at the ſame Time, by impoſing on me a Thouſand Cares, takes from me the poſſibility of preparing as I ought to do, for that Tranſmigration, which in a little Time I muſt paſs through.</p>
                  <p>In a Word, <hi>Right Noble Kerker,</hi> I deſire the Priviledge to end my Days in <hi>Conſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinople,</hi> among the <hi>Moſelmans,</hi> under the Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerable Shade of <hi>Moſks</hi> and <hi>Minarets,</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecrated to the Service and Honour of the <hi>Eternal <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nity.</hi> Let me not have worſe U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage than the ancient <hi>Roman</hi> Souldiers had, who when they had ſerved in the Wars ſuch a certain number of Years, were diſcharg'd with an Honourable Penſion.</p>
                  <p>This is all the Favour I requeſt, who have ſerv'd the <hi>Grand Signior</hi> faithfully and with
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:102965:27"/>Succeſs theſe Eight and Thirty Years, in a Country of <hi>Infidels.</hi> But if my Superiors ſhall determine otherwiſe, I am reſign'd to their Pleaſure, and to the Will of <hi>Deſtiny.</hi>

                  </p>
                  <p>It ſeems, this later has been a great Suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferer by the preſent War between <hi>France</hi> and the <hi>Confederate Princes;</hi> for his Country lying near the <hi>Rhine</hi> was expos'd to both Parties, and the <hi>French</hi> firſt enter'd it.</p>
                  <p>There were ſome <hi>Engliſh</hi> Troops in the <hi>French</hi> Army, who had conceiv'd an Impla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cable Revenge againſt the Subjects of the <hi>Palatine,</hi> in regard many of their Comrades had been barbarouſly handled by them. Wherefore they made great Devaſtation
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:102965:27"/>where-ever they came; burnt Five and Twenty great Villages to the Ground, and Five ſmall Cities. In a word, they quite ruin'd in Fifteen Days Time, the whole Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, which is eſteem'd the moſt pleaſant and agreeable Part of <hi>Europe.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This put the <hi>Elector</hi> all in Choler, and he wrote a ſharp Letter to the <hi>Mareſchal Tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>renne,</hi> threatning him in a furious Manner, and bidding him chuſe the Place, where he might fight with him in ſingle Duel. But the <hi>Sage Mareſchal</hi> retaining his uſual Mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, and not at all mov'd at the <hi>Palatines,</hi> Letter, anſwer'd it in theſe or the like Terms; <hi>That the Proceedings of the Engliſh Regiments were without his Order or Approbation; That he was infinitely troubled at the Violences which had been committed; and that the chief An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors had been puniſh'd: Nevertheleſs, he could not but Declare, That the cruel Treatment which the</hi> Engliſh <hi>had met with, had ſo exaſperated their Companions, that it was no wonder to ſee them execute their Revenge even on the very Inanimate Things. And that in the firſt heat and tranſport of their Fury, they had not lei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure to examine who were guilty and who not.</hi> He added likewiſe, <hi>That if the Poſt which the</hi> King <hi>his Maſter had appointed him, would per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit him to accept of his Challenge, he would not refuſe it, counting it an Honour to meaſure his Arms with thoſe of ſo</hi> Illuſtrious <hi>a</hi> Prince: <hi>But that as things were, he deſir'd to be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cus'd.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <pb n="30" facs="tcp:102965:28"/>
                  <p>In former Days ſuch an Anſwer as this, would have been taken for an Argument of Cowardiſe, in a Man profeſſing Arms. There was nothing more common among theſe <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidels,</hi> than to decide their private Controver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſies, Grudges and Quarrels by the Sword; and their Laws allow'd it. If any Man had accus'd another wronfully, or had done him any other injury, he did not run preſently to the <hi>Cadi's</hi> or Lawyers for Redreſs, but had Recourſe to his Arms: And whoſoever got the Victory, his Cauſe was pronounc'd juſt. But ſince the Commerce which has been e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtabliſh'd between the <hi>Moſelmans</hi> and the <hi>Nazarens,</hi> theſe later have learned to forſake ſo impious a Practice, being aſham'd that the Followers of <hi>Mahomet,</hi> whom they call <hi>Infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dels,</hi> ſhou'd outſtrip them in the Peaceable<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of their Temper, a Vertue ſo earneſtly recommended to the Practice of all Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians by <hi>Jeſus</hi> the <hi>Son</hi> of <hi>Mary.</hi> Beſides, they have found the inconvenience of theſe private Combats, and they are generally forbidden now in moſt Countries of <hi>Europe.</hi> This is owing to the Examples of the <hi>Moſelmans,</hi> whoſe Anger againſt each other ſcarce ever proceeds to contumelious Words, much leſs to Blows, or any Attempt upon Life. For when a Diſpute ariſes between Two True <hi>Believers,</hi> and they become never ſo little paſſionate thereupon, 'tis but for a Third Perſon, one of the <hi>Faithful,</hi> to interpoſe himſelf, and reproach them with violating the Laws of the <hi>Prophet,</hi> and the Honour of
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:102965:28"/>their Profeſſion, and they immediately are made Friends again. Such Magick there is in the Force of theſe Words; <hi>Fie, Fie! What? Moſelmans, and Quarrel?</hi> The uſual Repri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of the By-Standers. Which is an evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent Argument, That our <hi>Holy Religion</hi> has a greater Influence on the Hearts and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences of thoſe that profeſs it, than has <hi>that</hi> of the <hi>Nazarens.</hi> For whilſt theſe pretend to believe and honour the <hi>Meſſias</hi> as their Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giver, they diſobey him in their daily Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice, and ſo give the Lye to their Faith, diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covering that it has no Efficacy on their Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rals. Doubltleſs, the <hi>Meſſias</hi> was <hi>Holy, Chaſt, Peaceable, Humble</hi> and <hi>Harmleſs.</hi> But it is rare to find any of theſe Virtues among <hi>his</hi> Followers. <hi>He</hi> bid them return <hi>Good for E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil, Bleſſings for Curſes,</hi> and <hi>to ſuffer all Inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries patiently,</hi> after <hi>his</hi> Example; but they invert the Order of <hi>his</hi> Precepts, and read them backward, as they ſay <hi>Witches do the</hi> Paſter-noſter.</p>
                  <p>When <hi>Judas</hi> came to Seize him in the Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den of <hi>Gethſemani,</hi> with a Train of Officers and Ruffians, one of <hi>Jeſus</hi>'s Retinue drew his Whinnier, and cur off an Ear from the Servant of the <hi>High Prieſt.</hi> But the <hi>Son</hi> of <hi>Mary</hi> was ſo far from commending his Zeal in this, that <hi>he</hi> bid him <hi>put up his Sword,</hi> tel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling him withal, <hi>That whoſoever draws the Sword, ſhall periſh by the Sword.</hi> At the ſame Time, <hi>he</hi> reſtor'd the Fellows Ear again by a Miracle.</p>

For it will not be amiſs to let thee know the Particular Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances of this Combat, the good Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct of the <hi>French</hi> Generals, as alſo their Overſights and Errors: That thou mayſt make a right uſe of ſuch Examples, in the Difficulties which may environ thee through the Chance of War.</p>
                  <p>On the Ninth of this Inſtant <hi>Moon,</hi> the <hi>Confederate</hi> Forces amounting to Sixty Thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand Men, march'd with their Left Wing to a Place call'd <hi>Arken,</hi> and their Right to the Foreſt of <hi>Buſſeray,</hi> where they encamp'd, having before them a Village call'd <hi>Senef,</hi> ſituated in <hi>Brabant.</hi> They tarried there on the Tenth Day, and next Morning parted from thence, Marching in Three Lines, counting the Baggage for One. Whilſt the <hi>Prince de Vaudemont</hi> commanded a Body of Six Thouſand Spaniſh Horſe, to cover their March, and to skirmiſh with the <hi>French,</hi> if there ſhou'd be occaſion, 'till the whole Army were in Order.</p>
                  <pb n="34" facs="tcp:102965:30"/>
                  <p>As ſoon as the <hi>Prince of Conde</hi> was adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tis'd of theſe Motions, he was reſolv'd to take Advantage of their neceſſity, and to attack them, before they could poſſibly get together into a Body capable of ſuſtaining the Shock of the <hi>French</hi> Army, which was cloſely embattel'd. To this End he caus'd one Part of the Army with Four Pieces of Cannon, to paſs the River of <hi>Pilton,</hi> where unſuſpected, they might obſerve the Enemies Motions. Another part he poſted in a deep Valley, where the Confederates could not perceive them: And that nothing might be wanting to his full Information of their Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vances, he caus'd the <hi>Mareſchal</hi> of the <hi>Camp,</hi> with a conſiderable Detachment, to gain a certain Hill, from whence lying under the Covert of thick Woods, he might attend e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very Step of the Enemy, without being diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered himſelf.</p>
                  <p>When the <hi>Prince</hi> had made all thoſe Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parations, he ſent the <hi>Marquiſs de Rannes,</hi> and the <hi>Chevalier de Tilladet,</hi> with the Dragoons under their Command, to aſſault the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>federates not far from <hi>Senef.</hi> This was per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form'd with ſo much Vigor, that they drove them into the Village, with no little Slaugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of the <hi>Spaniards:</hi> But not ſatisfied with this, they attacqu'd them in the Village it ſelf; and after a long and bloody Conflict, the <hi>French</hi> beat 'em thence alſo, purſuing them into the Plain; till at laſt both the whole Armies were engag'd <hi>pell-mell.</hi> Then was the Fight Cruel and Fierce, the Officers
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:102965:30"/>of both ſides behaving themſelves with ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſing Bravery, and the Souldiers not ſhrink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing from their Valiant Leaders. But Fortune favour'd the <hi>French,</hi> who before they quitted the Plain, became Maſters of all the <hi>Hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>landers</hi> Baggage, Ammunition, Powder and Mony which they brought with them to pay the Army. Then the <hi>Prince</hi> of <hi>Conde</hi> chac'd them into the Village of <hi>Dufay,</hi> where the Confederates retrench'd themſelves under the Covert of a Caſtle, and a ſtrong Church. But that Active General would not ſuffer them to reſt long there; he ſet upon them on all Hands ſo furiouſly, that they were forced to abandon the Place, and enter the Plain the Second Time. The Battel had now laſted Five Hours, and great was the Slaughter on both Sides. The <hi>French</hi> took almoſt Four Thouſand Priſoners, and kill'd as many upon the Spot, beſides thoſe that they left wounded. Which ſo weaken'd and diſcourag'd the <hi>Confederates,</hi> That the next Day they retir'd, and left the <hi>French</hi> Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters of the Field.</p>
                  <p>Now I will tell thee, That had the Prince of <hi>Conde</hi> been contented with his Firſt Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctory at <hi>Senef,</hi> he had ſav'd abundance of <hi>French Blood.</hi> For, in that Fight, the <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>federates</hi> loſt above Two Thouſand Men, and the <hi>French</hi> ſcarce a Hundred. But the Fieryneſs of his Temper, carried him beyond his Judgment, to purſue them into difficult Places. So that in the winding up of the Matter, though the Victory was his, it coſt
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:102965:31"/>him above Fifteen Hundred Lives of his Souldiers, which might have been as well ſpar'd, and his Honour remain'd the ſame.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Valiant Seraſquier,</hi> I ſend thee this Nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rative, as a Chart by which to ſteer thy Courſe in the like Emergencies; adviſing thee to temper thy Courage with ſage Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct and Prudence, and not to ſacrifice thy Men to a Raſh Caprice of Martial Phrenſy.</p>

                     <hi>To</hi> Mehemet, <hi>an Exil'd</hi> Eunuch, <hi>at</hi> Al-Cairo <hi>in</hi> Egypt.</head>
                  <p>HOw changeable is the ſtate of Mortals; how inconſtant our Thoughts, Paſſions, Words and Actions! We are never fix'd long on any thing. If we are invited to caſt <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chor</hi> a while in ſome calm and ſerene Seaſon, whilſt we furl the Sails of Human Care and Anxiety; if we are permitted to careen and recruit our Weather-beaten Spirits, enjoying ſome ſhort interval of Reſt and Eaſe; the Indulgence ſoon expires, and we are forc'd to weigh and hoiſt with double Diligence, leſt we incur a Wreck. The Tempeſts rais'd by our Evil Stars, blow hard upon us; we run adrift, and are toſs'd up and down on the Billows of <hi>Human Miſery,</hi> without any approv'd Pilot, Chart or Compaſs to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect us in the uncertain Road of Life. We float at Random, in a Sea of perpetual Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zards and Difficulties.</p>
                  <p>O <hi>Mehemet!</hi> I will not now, as once for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly I did, wiſh my ſelf in one of the <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gyptian Pyramids,</hi> or court the Society of Ghoſts and Daemons: I will not take San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctuary in thoſe Superannuated Priſons of <hi>Royal Souls;</hi> nor ſeek Diverſion among the Dead. Not the black Maſquerades of <hi>Cheop's</hi>
                     <pb n="38" facs="tcp:102965:32"/>Sepulcher, danc'd each Night by Antique Shadows, or wildeſt Meaſures of Hobgob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lins in the Galleries of that horrid Pile, cou'd now relieve my Melancholy, or eaſe my Phrentick Pain: Becauſe the Entertainment is too narrow, cloſe and ſtale for ſuch a <hi>Soul</hi> as mine. I wou'd fain ramble through an Infinite Space, planted each Stage with Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minaries of new Idea's, uncouth Forms, and ſtrange <hi>Chimeras.</hi> I wou'd ſee the <hi>Eſſence of all Beings</hi> that I have already ſeen, revers'd, turn'd upſide down, or inſide out, or any way transform'd, ſo as I might not know 'em again. I wou'd have all the <hi>Elements</hi> change their Qualities; the <hi>Fire</hi> to loſe its Innate Heat, and <hi>Water</hi> to expunge its Moiſture; the <hi>Earth</hi> take <hi>Fire,</hi> and blow it ſelf up in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Ninth Sphere, whilſt the <hi>Air</hi> ſhall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denſe and cruſh it ſelf into a Solid Globe, producing a new Race of Minerals, Vege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tables, and Living Creatures, which our Old Purblind World ne'er ſaw before. I wou'd have flying Trees, and Birds whoſe out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpread Claws take Rooting in the Air, and grow like <hi>Baucis</hi> and <hi>Philemon;</hi> their Wings to Branches turn'd, their Feathers into Leaves. Beſides a Thouſand Kinds of Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters more than ever <hi>Ovid</hi> ſpoke of in his <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tamorphoſis.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>After all this, I would go up and view the <hi>Orbs</hi> above, reſtore the Rotten Corruptible <hi>Heavens,</hi> pull all the <hi>Bulls</hi> and <hi>Bears,</hi> the <hi>Scorpions, Lions, Centaurs,</hi> and other anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quated Beaſts out of the Sky; make the New
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:102965:32"/>Star of <hi>Caſſiopaeia</hi> pay a Swinging Fine, for her damn'd late unmannerly Appearance in the <hi>Senate</hi> of the Stars.</p>
                  <p>Then wou'd I ſet up an Inquiſition for the <hi>Comets,</hi> to know from whence they are, and what their Buſineſs is, among the <hi>Orbs</hi> above. I wou'd examine all the <hi>Conſtella<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,</hi> and know the meaning of their Names, and ill-ſhap'd Figures. And then I'd trace the <hi>Milky Way,</hi> mounting directly to the <hi>Holieſt Heavens</hi> of all.</p>
                  <p>There perhaps I ſhou'd begin to be Modeſt and Sober, conſidering that it is the <hi>Preſence-Chamber</hi> of the <hi>Omnipotent.</hi> I wou'd not broach Sedition, nor talk Factiouſly before the <hi>King of all Things.</hi> But behaving my ſelf like a Courtier during the Publick Audience, I wou'd afterwards retire, and ſcamper through the Endleſs Fields, beyond the <hi>Coe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lum Empyraeum;</hi> where I wou'd either find out new Worlds, or Room for them. No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing ſhou'd confine my Search, leſs than <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finity.</hi> Is not our Senſe, Fanſy and Reaſon without Bounds? Are not theſe Parts of the Univerſe? And has <hi>God</hi> made any Part greater than the Whole? This is a Contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction in Nature. He has given us Facul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, which, if rightly us'd, cannot err. Our Conceptions are ſquar'd to his Eternal Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>del of the World, if we do not debauch our own Thoughts, or ſuffer 'em to be cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted by others. He is the <hi>Primitive</hi> and <hi>Original Reaſon,</hi> the Everlaſting Common
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:102965:33"/>
                     <hi>Senſorium</hi> of Nature, <hi>in whom,</hi> and <hi>by whom</hi> we all ſee that we have Eyes; hear that we have Ears; ſmell that we have Noſes; taſte that we have a Tongue; and feel that we are all over full of Senſible Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits.</p>
                  <p>Oh <hi>God!</hi> thy Praiſes are without Begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning or End: Thou art an Eternal Circle of Wonders and Miracles. Thou ſurpaſſeſt all our Sublimeſt Thoughts; no Words can decypher the Skirts of <hi>thy</hi> Garment. On thee Infinite Worlds have reſted from Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Ages. Thou art no Niggard of thy Gifts. Why ſhou'd Infinite Goodneſs and Bounty be traduc'd by <hi>Infidels?</hi> They ſay the World is but ſo many Thouſand Years Old, perhaps Five or Six. It is a damn'd Blaſphemy, thus ſlily to Calumniate the <hi>Om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nipotent,</hi> and to ſay by Craft he was not ſo early Gracious as he might have been. What ſhould ail the <hi>Eternal,</hi> that he was not in a Condition to produce the World before? Or was he in a ſullen Humour, that he ſhould ſuffer a lapſe of Indetermi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate Ages, before he wou'd diſplay his At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributes?</p>
                  <p>Oh, No! Suffer not this Doctrin to take Root in thy <hi>Soul,</hi> My Dear <hi>Mehmet,</hi> but Remember, there is no Envy in the <hi>Dei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.</hi> Doubtleſs he was as <hi>Good, Powerful, Juſt,</hi> and <hi>Wiſe,</hi> from all Eternity, as at <hi>Moſes</hi>'s Hour of the <hi>Creation,</hi> or as he is now, and ever will be <hi>World without End;
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:102965:33"/>Amen:</hi> As the <hi>Nazareens</hi> have in their Prayers.</p>
                  <p>My <hi>Mehmet,</hi> let us ſhake off the Preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dices of Education, with all the Prepoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſions and Falſe <hi>Dogma's</hi> of our Early Years, and adhere to firm Reaſon, and the Inſpirations that are from beyond the Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible Frame.</p>

                  <p>THe Affairs of <hi>France</hi> ſeem to be in a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry flouriſhing Condition. This Invinci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble <hi>Monarch</hi> not only conquers Cities and Provinces by Force, but ſome yield to him voluntarily, courting his Protection.</p>
                  <p>Here are arriv'd Deputies from the <hi>Senate</hi> of <hi>Meſſina</hi> in <hi>Sicily,</hi> to deſire the <hi>King</hi> to free that City and People from the Yoke of <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Tyranny, and to number them a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong <hi>his</hi> Subjects. They are receiv'd with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out much Ceremony on the part of this Court; which affects to appear Stately and Reſerv'd at ſuch a Juncture. However, there is no point of Humanity or Hoſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table Uſage neglected toward theſe Stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers. In a word, they are entertain'd as Friends of a lower Degree; and they eſteem this a ſufficient Happineſs,</p>
                  <p>It ſeems the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Government was ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Severe and Cruel; laying inſupportable Taxes on the Inhabitants, and fleecing them of their Silver and Gold by a Thouſand Tricks and Inventions of State. It was a Crime to grow Rich, and no leſs to be ſo Poor as to deny the Payment of the <hi>Gabels.</hi> The one put a Man in danger of the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſition; the other expos'd him to the Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leys,
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:102965:34"/>or ſome worſe Slavery in the Mines of <hi>Peru.</hi> On whomſoever the <hi>Viceroy</hi> or <hi>his Officers</hi> caſt an ill Eye, that Perſon was ſure to be ruin'd, if he did not make his Eſcape, or preſent his Enemy with the Value per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps of half his Wealth; and he muſt take it as a Favour too, that they wou'd com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound at ſuch eaſie Rates. For, theſe greedy <hi>Harpies</hi> are ſeldom contented with leſs than all a Man has.</p>
                  <p>Infinite other Oppreſſions the People ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer'd under, which at laſt ſo wearied their Patience, that they began to Cabal and form Conſpiracies againſt the <hi>Viceroy:</hi> And it was not only the Vulgar that thus ſought after Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty, but the chief of the Citizens, and ſome of the <hi>Senators.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Theſe all unanimouſly agreed to treat underhand with the <hi>French King,</hi> to repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent to him their Grievances, with the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent ſtate of the whole Iſland: For they had heard the Fame and Character of his Perſon and Government: And they were well ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied they could not ſubmit to a better or more generous Maſter than him. The <hi>King</hi> undertakes to reſcue them from the <hi>Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh</hi> Bondage, provided they wou'd aſſiſt him with what Succours they could ſpare, and inſtruct his Officers in thoſe Things which would facilitate the Reduction of the Iſle.</p>
                  <p>He ſent Forces accordingly at the Begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the Year, under the Command of the <hi>Chevalier de Valbelle,</hi> who acquitted himſelf
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:102965:35"/>very ſucceſsfully, having perform'd many Conſiderable Exploits, and taken ſeveral Towns, Caſtles, and other ſtrong Places from the <hi>Spaniards.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The <hi>Senate</hi> of <hi>Meſſina</hi> being encouraged by theſe proſperous Beginnings, thought it high Time actually to ſurrender themſelves up to the <hi>French King:</hi> And 'tis on this Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rand the Deputies are come.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>King</hi> being inform'd that the <hi>Cheva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lier de Valbelle</hi> wanted greater Forces to Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quer the Places which remain in the <hi>Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niards</hi> Hands, immediately gave Orders for a certain Number of Veſſels to be Fitted and Mann'd under the Command of the <hi>Duke of Vivonne.</hi> He gave a Commiſſion alſo to the <hi>Marquis de Velavoir,</hi> with a conſiderable Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my of Men; ordering him to make all ſpeed for <hi>Sicily,</hi> and to joyn the <hi>Chevalier de Val<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>belle,</hi> or to act ſeparately as occaſion of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer'd.</p>
                  <p>They ſay, the <hi>Duke of Vivonne</hi> will ſet Sail with his Fleet about the Beginning of the Firſt Moon: He is eſteem'd a good Souldier, though ſome of the <hi>Grandees</hi> and <hi>Peers</hi> of the Realm envy him, in regard he was rais'd to the High Dignities he poſſeſſes, through the Mediation of his Siſter, <hi>Madam de Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſpan,</hi> one of the <hi>King</hi>'s Concubines: For, he was before only <hi>Count of Vivonne;</hi> but now he is <hi>Duke, Peer</hi> and <hi>Mareſchal</hi> of <hi>France,</hi> as alſo Admiral of the <hi>Mediterranean</hi> Gallies.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Prince</hi> of <hi>Conde,</hi> once in Company with ſome of the <hi>Grandees,</hi> and making a
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:102965:35"/>Compariſon between the <hi>Mareſchals Feuillade</hi> and <hi>Vivonne,</hi> he ſaid, that <hi>Feuillade</hi> got his Honour by the Sword, and <hi>Vivonne</hi> by the Scabbard, reflecting thereby on his Siſter.</p>
                  <p>It was not the Firſt Time that <hi>Prince</hi> us'd the Liberty of his Tongue in affronting Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple; he was always daring and bold in ſuch Caſes. When he was Young, and tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velling through <hi>Picardy,</hi> he was to paſs by a certain <hi>Convent</hi> or <hi>Religious Houſe</hi> on the Road, where the <hi>Superiour</hi> with all his <hi>Der<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viches</hi> came out to meet him, and to pay him the Ceremonies and Acknowledgments due to his Quality. The <hi>Superiour</hi> was ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king a long Elaborate Harangue, in Compli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to the <hi>Prince,</hi> when he all in Frolick call'd aloud to know <hi>what a Clock it was.</hi> The poor <hi>Derviches</hi> ſtriving who ſhould moſt readily ſatisfie him, cry'd out all together, <hi>It is Mid-day, My Lord;</hi> when he made them this wild Anſwer, <hi>Then get you all gone, and make an end of your Speech to the Devil by Midnight; for I'll hear no more of your Long-winded Flattery.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thou wilt ſay, This was an odd ſort of Expreſſion in a <hi>Prince:</hi> But it muſt be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted to the Fieryneſs of his Conſtitution, which in his Youth ſpurr'd him on to a Thouſand Extravagancies. He corrected theſe in Time, and inſtead of ſuch vain Pranks and Flaſhes of his Sparkling Nature, he grew inflam'd with Noble Ardours for his <hi>King</hi> and <hi>Country.</hi> He was commonly call'd the <hi>French Lion</hi> and <hi>Mars,</hi> being eſteemed
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:102965:36"/>the Boldeſt Man in the Kingdom. <hi>Mareſchal Turenne,</hi> who was no Stranger to his Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius, us'd to ſay, <hi>That ſince the Brave</hi> Hora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius Curtius, <hi>there never was a Man born of Woman ſo full of Fire and Spirit as the Prince of</hi> Conde.</p>
                  <p>Yet, which is more to be admir'd, that Two ſuch Qualities ſhould meet in the ſame Genius, he is a great Stateſman, as well as a Valiant Souldier. He has a prodigious Aim at the Good or Ill Succeſs of Enterprizes. And his Counſels are generally Fortunate.</p>
                  <p>As theſe Accompliſhments have render'd him beloved by the Generality of the <hi>French</hi> Nation; ſo his Inconſtancy and ſiding with different Factions, have made him ſuſpected both by the Court and the Parliaments. All Sides are ſhy of him, and reſerv'd in their Addreſſes. Tho he has done Services enough one would think, to efface the Memory of his former Failings; yet the Civilities he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceives from the <hi>King,</hi> are only the faint Sprinklings of <hi>Court-Holy-Water. So hard a Thing it is for an Eminent Perſon to recover the Eſteem which he has once loſt by making falſe Steps.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This <hi>Monarch</hi> is obſerv'd to be very Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant to thoſe he Loves, never putting to Death any of his Favourites, tho he has often caus'd them to be Arreſted. He is very Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fable, and of no difficult Acceſs: Civil and Courteous to the Pooreſt People, returning the Salutes of his Subjects with much Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſcenſion. He is Amorous alſo, and indulges
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:102965:36"/>that ſoft Paſſion in the midſt of all his glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Enterprizes. He had once Three Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreſſes together, one whereof was of Vulgar Parentage, the other was a Noble-Woman, and the Third a Nun. Which occaſion'd this Jeſt to be put on him; <hi>That he went about to unite the Three Eſtates, and faſten them to the Intereſt of the Crown.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Among the other Diverſions of this great Prince, he takes a particular Pleaſure in Mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nificent Buildings. And his new Palace at <hi>Verſailles</hi> is eſteem'd one of the Wonders of the World, for Beauty and Art. As ſoon as it was finiſh'd, a certain <hi>Poet</hi> preſented the <hi>King</hi> with this <hi>Diſtich,</hi>

                     <hi>To the</hi> Vizir Baſſa, <hi>at</hi> Conſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinople.</head>
                  <p>I am Acquainted with a <hi>French</hi> Merchant in this City, who often trades to <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantinople, Smyrna, Aleppo,</hi> and other Cities of the <hi>Levant.</hi> He knows nothing of me or my Buſineſs at <hi>Paris,</hi> farther than other People, who take me for a Native of <hi>Mol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>davia,</hi> and one whom the Deſire of Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge has brought hither, where the <hi>Sciences</hi> have taken up <hi>their Reſidence.</hi> Beſides, they may imagin, that the Hopes of Preferment in the <hi>Church,</hi> were one Inducement to my Travelling thus far from the Place of my Nativity. Since I have all along profeſs'd my ſelf a <hi>Student</hi> and <hi>Candidate</hi> of the <hi>Prieſthood;</hi> and it is generally known how familiar I have been with <hi>Cardinal Richlieu,</hi> and his Succeſſor <hi>Mazarini.</hi> Whatever their Thoughts be, thou may'ſt aſſure thy ſelf, that in the Main, I have taken Care to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceal my True Circumſtances, and the Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs of the <hi>Grand Signior</hi> entruſted to my Charge. But to come to the Buſineſs.</p>
                  <p>The Merchant of whom I ſpeak, is call'd <hi>Monſieur de Vaubrun;</hi> a Man of Generous Extraction, and by his Induſtry he has ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quir'd a conſiderable Wealth. This Perſon
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:102965:37"/>not long ſince, came from <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> and has made it his Buſineſs, ever ſince his Return, to extol the <hi>ſingular Morality</hi> and <hi>Juſtice</hi> of the <hi>Muſſulmans.</hi> In all Comapnies where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever he comes, 'tis uſual with him to ſay, <hi>The</hi> Turks <hi>are perfect Saints in Compariſon with us.</hi> And to confirm his Aſſertion, he relates many pretty Paſſages of Things hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pening whilſt he reſided at the Imperial Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; all in Honour of the <hi>True Believers.</hi> Which has drawn upon him no ſmall Hatred, Envy and Perſecution from the <hi>Prieſts,</hi> and their more bigotted <hi>Followers.</hi> However, he ſhrinks not from his Word, but ſtoutly Main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains the Truth of his Aſſertions. And ſome Men of Senſe who have heard the Stories he tells, and the Elegant Account he gives of our <hi>Religion</hi> and <hi>Morals,</hi> cannot forbear cry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out, <hi>They are almoſt proſelyted to the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hometan Faith.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Among the reſt, he recounts an Extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary Occurrence, which happen'd to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf at his parting from <hi>Conſtantinople;</hi> which I thought it worth while to acquaint thee with, in regard it is much taken notice of in <hi>Raris</hi> by all that hear it; and conduces not a little to raiſe in the <hi>French,</hi> an higher E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteem of the <hi>Muſſulmans</hi> and our <hi>Holy-Faith,</hi> than they were wont to have.</p>
                  <p>It ſeems <hi>Monſieur de Vaubrun</hi> had enter<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>d into a ſtrict Parnerſhip with <hi>Muſtapha Zari,</hi> a Native of <hi>Turcomania,</hi> dwelling at <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantinople,</hi> and trading in Silks Their mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual Traffick and Correſpondence held for
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:102965:38"/>the ſpace of Four Years; at the end of which, the <hi>French-Man</hi> being call'd Home to his Native Country, by Letters from ſome of his Friends, to take Poſſeſſion of an E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate newly fallen to him by the Death of an Uncle, he gave his Partner notice of it, telling him his Reſolution was fix'd to depart very ſpeedily from the <hi>Port,</hi> and take his Voyage for <hi>France;</hi> at the ſame Time de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiring, that the Accounts between them might be ſettled. Which was done accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly; and in caſting them up, it was agreed upon by both, that this <hi>Monſieur Vaubrun</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main'd indebted Nine Hundred <hi>Zequins</hi> to <hi>Muſtapha Zari.</hi> There was no Contention in the Caſe: <hi>Monſieur</hi> very readily gave him Five Bags Seal'd, and deſir'd him to tell the <hi>Money. No,</hi> replied <hi>Muſtapha, We have dealt together thus long, and I have found you an ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt Man; God forbid that I ſhould miſtruſt my Friend at our laſt parting.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This was done the Day before <hi>Monſieur de Vaubrun</hi> was to take his Leave of <hi>Conſtanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nople;</hi> for he had Hired Horſes to Travel by Land to <hi>Smyrna,</hi> his Buſineſs ſo requiring. Therefore both Parties being well ſatisfied, they bid Adieu to each other, wiſhing mutual Happineſs. The next Day <hi>Monſieur de Vau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brun</hi> took Horſe for <hi>Smyrna,</hi> having diſpatch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed all his Affairs at the <hi>Imperial Port.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>It ſo happen'd, That as ſoon as he was gone, <hi>Muſtapha</hi> had occaſion to pay a Thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand Five Hundred <hi>Zequins</hi> to a <hi>Merchant</hi> of <hi>Holland.</hi> Wherefore having newly received
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:102965:38"/>thoſe Five Bags from his Partner, he with them, made up the Sum due to the <hi>Dutch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,</hi> ſaying withal, That he had not told the Money in thoſe Five Bags, in regard he took them on the Credit of a very worthy and honeſt Man, who had been his Partner. But the Jealous <hi>Chriſtian</hi> would not ſhew ſo much Generoſity; for he preſently broke up the Seals in the preſence of <hi>Muſtapha;</hi> and having told over the Money, ſaid 'twas all right, and was very fairly putting it up a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain. But <hi>Muſtapha,</hi> who had a quick Eye, and being well vers'd in telling of Money, perceiv'd there was a great Overplus above Nine Hundred <hi>Zequins.</hi> Wherefore he bid the <hi>Dutchman</hi> hold his Hand, till he had told the Bags over himſelf; for he ſuſpected there was ſome miſtake. The <hi>Nazarene</hi> durſt not deny a <hi>True Believer</hi> this Priviledge, under the <hi>Grand Signior</hi>'s Protection, whatever he wou'd have done in his own Country. So that when <hi>Muſtapha</hi> had run the Money o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, he found Eleven Hundred and Fifty <hi>Ze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quins</hi> in Bags by themſelves, and gave the reſt to the <hi>Hollander.</hi> In a word, having diſpatch'd that Payment, he ſent an <hi>Expreſs</hi> away immediately with the Two Hundred and Fifty <hi>Zequins</hi> to <hi>Monſieur de Vaubrun,</hi> who he knew was to tarry ſome Days at a Town on the Road, about Twenty Leagues from <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> commanding the <hi>Courier</hi> to deliver him this Meſſage in writing. <hi>My Friend,</hi> God <hi>forbid that I ſhou'd detain any Thing beyond my Right, or deal with thee as a
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:102965:39"/>certain</hi> Frank <hi>would have done by me: For, thou know'ſt that I took the Money on thy Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit without telling it, but being to pay it away this Day to a</hi> Dutch Merchant, <hi>he not having the ſame Faith, wou'd tell it; and finding theſe Two Hundred and Fifty</hi> Zequins <hi>over and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove the Sum ſuppoſed to be in the Bags, yet would have ſmuggl'd them in his</hi> Dutch <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, had not I diſcern'd his Fraud, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented him. I ſend them to thee as thy Right, ſuppoſing 'twas ſome overſight.</hi> God <hi>prohibites all Injuſtice.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This Relation I had from <hi>Monſieur de Vau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brun</hi>'s own Mouth: And I tell thee, it makes a great noiſe in <hi>Paris.</hi> I leave it to thy Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture Reſolves, whether that honeſt <hi>Muſſulman</hi> deſerves not ſome particular and publick Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour to be done him, who by ſuch a rare Action of Juſtice, has rais'd a Noble Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter of the <hi>Muſſulmans</hi> among the <hi>Infidels.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Moſt Illuſtrious and Serene <hi>Baſſa,</hi> I pray the <hi>Almighty</hi> and <hi>All good God,</hi> to have thee in his Holy Protection, and augment thy Vertues and Felicities.</p>

                     <hi>To</hi> Ibrahim Eli Zeid, Hadgi, Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fendi, Preacher <hi>to the</hi> Serag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lio.</head>
                  <p>HEre has happen'd ſomething of Late, which the <hi>Prieſts</hi> magnify as an Appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent <hi>Miracle;</hi> whilſt, for ought I know, 'tis only a pure Effect of <hi>Nature.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thou art not to learn, that the <hi>Nazarens</hi> have their <hi>Saints</hi> in great Veneration: That they invoke then in their Neceſſities, ſet up their Images and Pictures in <hi>Temples</hi> to be ador'd: That they preſerve their Bones, Aſhes, Hair, Garments, or any Thing that deſerves the Name of a Sacred Relique? That they enſhrine theſe in Coffins, Urns, Cheſts, and other Veſſels of Gold and Silver, adorn'd with Precious Stones: That they place them in their <hi>Moſcks,</hi> as in Sanctua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries; ſometimes under their <hi>Altars,</hi> at o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Times upon them: Some in particular <hi>Oratories</hi> or <hi>Chapels,</hi> others in the <hi>Choire<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                     </hi> That they carry them in Proceſſion in Times of Publick Calamity, and on certain <hi>Feſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vals;</hi> thinking by this means to pacify the Wrath of <hi>Heaven,</hi> and draw down the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Benediction. Thou art not ignorant alſo, That they believe the <hi>Saints</hi> are <hi>Guar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dians</hi> of certain Kingdoms, Provinces, Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties,
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:102965:40"/>Families, and even of Private Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons.</p>
                  <p>Hence St. <hi>Denis</hi> is eſteem'd the Patron of <hi>France;</hi> St. <hi>James</hi> of <hi>Spain;</hi> St. <hi>George</hi> of <hi>England;</hi> and ſo of other Nations. Each City alſo has its peculiar <hi>Guardian Saint.</hi> Hence St. <hi>Anthony</hi> is accounted the Patron of <hi>Padua;</hi> St. <hi>Mark</hi> of <hi>Venice;</hi> and, to come to the Purpoſe, St. <hi>Geneviéve</hi> is ador'd by the Citizens of <hi>Paris,</hi> as the Patroneſs of this Place.</p>
                  <p>There is a Beautiful <hi>Temple</hi> built in Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of <hi>her,</hi> on the Higheſt Ground in the City, which alſo is call'd by <hi>her Name,</hi> the <hi>Mountain of St. Geneviéve.</hi> On the Decline of this, there is a Fountain of Delicate Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, which is called, <hi>the Fountain of St. Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viéve.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>They attribute many Miracles to this <hi>Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>male-Saint,</hi> ſome of which ſhe perform'd in her Life-time, others after her Death, if we may believe what the <hi>Prieſts</hi> affirm, and what is Recorded in the Hiſtory of her Life, in the Annals of <hi>Paris,</hi> and the Archives of the <hi>Convent</hi> belonging to <hi>her</hi> Temple. For there is a certain number of <hi>Dorviches,</hi> of the chief Nobility in <hi>Paris,</hi> who conſecrate them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves for ever to a Religious Life, in Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of <hi>this</hi> Virgin.</p>
                  <p>They meet Twice a Day in the <hi>Choire</hi> of the <hi>Church,</hi> all array'd in long Robes of white Linnen, where they chant aloud the Praiſes of St. <hi>Geneviéve.</hi> As oft they aſſemble, at different Hours in a private Chappel in their Cloy ſtere, to
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:102965:40"/>perform the like Devotions. Thoſe who are choſen into this Order, are all Perſons of Sweet and Lovely Countenances, graceful De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meanour, and learned Education. One ſhall not ſee ſo much Regularity, Order, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vout Modeſty, in any <hi>Church</hi> in <hi>Paris,</hi> as ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears in this, at the Time of Celebrating their Divine Myſteries. Yet, for ought I know, all this may be but Hypocriſie and pious Artifice, to attract the greater Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence from the People, who are preſent at their Ceremonies. I my ſelf was aſtoniſhed once, when being there, I ſaw a Beautiful Youth approach the Altar with a Golden <hi>Cenſer,</hi> hanging at a Chain which he held in one Hand; whilſt with the other he waſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Rich Perfume toward the Statues, which ſtood on high behind the Altar. He had the very Signature of Vertue in his Face. Beſides, a certain Luſtre that ſeem'd to ſpring all on a ſudden into his Eyes and Cheeks, diſcovering ſome inward Rapture of his <hi>Soul.</hi> Methought he look'd like one of the <hi>Pages</hi> of <hi>Eden,</hi> as they are deſcribed in the <hi>Holy Alcoran.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I proteſt it was impoſſible for me to fix my Eyes upon him, and not to feel the Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions of Platonick Love. He deported him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf with a Grace which cannot be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed.</p>
                  <p>Afterwards I contracted an intimate Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliarity with him on the account of <hi>Ara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bick,</hi> which he learns of me. He is a Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of excellent natural Abilities<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and well
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:102965:41"/>vers'd in Languages, and all manner of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine and Human Learning.</p>
                  <p>Pardon this Digreſſion, <hi>Venerable Hadgi,</hi> in regard I cou'd not forbear mentioning a Perſon of whom I have a great deal more to ſay, than can well be compriſed in one Letter. Hereafter I will communicate a far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Account of him, whilſt I now return to the <hi>Church</hi> of St. <hi>Geneviéve.</hi> In the upper part of the <hi>Choire,</hi> Four Fillars of <hi>Jaſper,</hi> with Four Golden Images of <hi>Angels</hi> on the Tops, ſupport the <hi>Shrine</hi> of <hi>this</hi> Saint, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in lyes encloſed all that remains of her Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy. Several Wax Tapers burn before it Day and Night. The Devouter ſort of Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple kneel and kiſs the Pillars which ſuſtain the admirable Reliques. They bring their Linnen and other Veſtments to the <hi>Prieſt,</hi> who is appointed for this Office. He faſtens them in the Cleft of a long Pole, and then raiſes that End up to the <hi>Shrine,</hi> which is very near as high as the Roof of the <hi>Church.</hi> He touches the Shrine with the Linnen, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and having done ſo, he takes it down again; when pronouncing a Benediction on it, in the Name of the <hi>Saint,</hi> he reſtores it to the Party whoſe it is.</p>
                  <p>They believe that Linnen or any Thing elſe belonging to the Body, being ſo touch'd and bleſs'd, has Power to chaſe away Mala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, to preſerve them from Dangers, to eaſe Women in Childbirth, and to make them proſper in all Things. So profound is the <hi>Attach</hi> which they have for this famous
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:102965:41"/>
                     <hi>Saint.</hi> But whether there be any<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Thing more in it than Superſtition and Bigotry, <hi>God</hi> only knows. However the Inhabitants of <hi>Paris,</hi> eſteem this Shrine, as the <hi>Trojans</hi> did their <hi>Palladium,</hi> and the <hi>Romans</hi> their <hi>Ancile,</hi> which fell from <hi>Heaven,</hi> as <hi>Numa Pompilius</hi> made them believe.</p>
                  <p>When the City is threaten'd with any Publick Calamity, this <hi>Shrine</hi> is taken down with Abundance of Pomp and Solemnity, and carry'd in Proceſſion through the Streets; thinking thereby to divert the Vengeance of <hi>Heaven,</hi> and appeaſe the Anger of the <hi>Omni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potent.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Such was the Caſe here lately: There having fallen ſuch an <hi>Overplus</hi> of continual Rains, as threaten'd to deſtroy all the Corn and Herbage, with the Fruits of the Earth; beſides the Damage had been already done to Innumerable Perſons in their Houſes and Goods by the vaſt Innundations.</p>
                  <p>This occaſion'd a Decree to come out for the taking down the Body of St. <hi>Geneviéve?</hi> and carrying it in Solemn Proceſſion to the Temple of <hi>Noſtre Dame:</hi> Which was ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly perform'd on the 17th. of this Moon. In the Proceſſion were ſeen all the Religious Orders in this City, both of Men and Women; the Parliament of <hi>Paris,</hi> the Chamber of Accompts; the Court of Aides; the Court of Moneys, with the whole Body of the Citizens.</p>
                  <p>But no ſooner was the <hi>Shrine</hi> of St. <hi>Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viéve</hi> brought into the open Air, when the
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:102965:42"/>Rain ceas'd, the Clouds diſpers'd, and the Sky became Serene and Clear: And ſo it has continued over ſince.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Prieſts</hi> will have this to be an Effect of Sr. <hi>Genevieve</hi>'s Interceſſion with <hi>God</hi> for the Province and City committed to <hi>her</hi> Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tronage. And the People are willing enough to believe it. If this Shrine be as efficacious in cauſing Rain, when there is a Drought, as the Inhabitants of <hi>Paris</hi> affirm, it may nor unfitly be compared to the <hi>Lapis Manalis</hi> of the Ancient <hi>Romans.</hi> This was a certain great Stone, which in Time of Exceſſive Dryneſs, the <hi>Romans</hi> us'd to draw into the City with vaſt Ropes, by the Gate <hi>Capena,</hi> whilſt the <hi>Prieſts</hi> of the <hi>God Mars,</hi> danc'd before it, and all the <hi>Veſtals</hi> left the Sacred Fire, to follow the Proceſſion. They drew the Stone to the Temple of the <hi>Goddeſs Flo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ra,</hi> where they ſtrew'd upon it a Handful of wither'd Flowers and Herbs. Then im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately it began to Rain, and they let the Stone lye there, as a Memorial before the Temple of the Goddeſs, till they had e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough of that ſort of Weather, to ſecure the Growth and Maturity of the Vegetables; and then they drew it back again in the ſame manner as before, only each <hi>Veſtal</hi> now car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried ſome of the Sacred Fire in an Earthen Veſſel, whereas before they carried none.</p>
                  <p>Whether there be any real Efficacy in thoſe Religious Ceremonies, or no, is not in my Power to determine: But 'tis certain, that every Nation conſides much in the Myſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:102965:42"/>taught them by their <hi>Prieſts.</hi> The Force of Education prevails on moſt Men even to old Age; in regard they think it an Impiety to examine or queſtion the Traditions of their Fathers, eſpecially when <hi>Heaven</hi> it ſelf confirms their Implicite Faith, by ſeeming to regard and anſwer their Religious Addreſſes, in ſo peculiar a Manner as theſe foremen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion'd Inſtances deſcribe.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Sage Effendi,</hi> Tell me whether it be He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſie to affirm, That <hi>God</hi> has ſent <hi>Prophets</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to all Nations, each furniſh'd with Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions and Doctrines agreeable to the <hi>Genius</hi> of the People whom they were to teach? And that he is not diſpleas'd at the various Rites and Ceremonies by which every di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinct Region and Climate adore <hi>his Divine <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nity?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Satisfy me in this, and then thou ſhalt be more than <hi>Apollo</hi> in my Eſteem; for, I am full of Doubts.</p>

                  <head>
                     <hi>To</hi> Hamet, Reis Effendi, Principal Secretary <hi>of the</hi> Ottoman Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire.</head>
                  <p>IT is above Ten Years ago ſince I gave thee an Account of the Renowned <hi>Mareſchal de Turenne:</hi> Wherein I did not pretend his compleat Hiſtory, or preſent thee with his full Character; but only to inform thee of ſome remarkable Paſſages in his Life, and to draw an imperfect Idea of his Vertues. Which though they were very great, yet were not ſufficient to skreen him from the Chance of War, and the Stroke of a Violent Death.</p>
                  <p>On the Six and Twentieth of the <hi>Moon</hi> of <hi>July,</hi> this <hi>great General,</hi> having given all neceſſary Orders for a Battel, with the Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perialiſts in <hi>Alſatia,</hi> was ſurveying a certain rais'd Ground near <hi>Strasbourg,</hi> on which he deſign'd to plant a Battery; when a Cannon Shot from the Town, guided by Fate more than by the Gunners Aim or Skill, came gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zing along on the Earth, and in its Carcer gave this <hi>Heroe</hi> a Mortal Blow on the Breaſt, of which he inſtantly died, without ſpeaking a Word.</p>
                  <p>There was an Officer of the Artillery in his Company, who ſpied the Courſe of the
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:102965:45"/>Bullet at a Diſtance, and happily ſtarted out of the Way. He reports, that <hi>Monſieur Turenne</hi> ſaw the ſame, but whether out of the Greatneſs of his Spirit, which would not ſuffer him to appear timerous of <hi>Death,</hi> or whether his extream Thoughtfulneſs on the approaching Battel, kept him from provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding for his own Safety; 'tis certain he ſtood Immoveable, and ſuſtain'd the Fatal Stroke which coſt him his Life.</p>
                  <p>The Court of <hi>France</hi> laments his Death, with extraordinary Demonſtrations of Sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row: And ſo does all the Kingdom. Indeed they have Reaſon: <hi>France</hi> having never ſent into the Field a Man more accompliſhed with all the Vertues and Heroick Qualities requiſite in a <hi>great General.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>They relate Two or Three remarkable Paſſages of his Life, which either happen'd ſince I wrote my former Letter to thee about him; or at leaſt they came not to my know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge at that Time.</p>
                  <p>One was a little after his Brother the <hi>Duke of Bouillon</hi>'s Death, when he was ſeen to weep very affectionately, tho he endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour'd to hide his Paſſion from the Obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of others. Which was taken notice of as an Argument of his Compaſſionate Temper; and that all the Blood which had been ſpilt in his ſight, and under his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct, had not diminiſh'd his Natural Ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſs and Humanity.</p>
                  <p>He was ſincerely Modeſt, without giving the World any occaſion to judge, that he
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:102965:46"/>only affected to appear ſo. For when any of his Friends or Creatures would run in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to <hi>Hyperboles,</hi> in extolling his Actions, he would not by a feigned Humility, and denying all they ſaid, lay a Train for greater Flatteries; but he ſo diſcreetly mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derated his Anſwers, that at the ſame Time he appeared ſenſible of his True Merit, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the leaſt Symptom of Arrogance or Vain-Glory.</p>
                  <p>So when ſome Lords came to condole the Loſs of his Brother, that they might com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort him, they turn'd the Diſcourſe to a Panegyrick on himſelf, highly extolling the whole Series of his Heroick Performances. But looking on them with a ſtedfaſt Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity, and fetching a deep Sigh, he reply'd<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
                     <hi>It is the Opinion of the World, that I am ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing vers'd in the Affairs of War: It would he an Ingrateful Preſumption to oppoſe the Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Sentiment. But, I can aſſure you, there is nothing more certain, than that much of my Knowledge in this kind, is owing to my Deceas'd Brother, who by Rules taught me many advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tagious Improvements of Martial Diſcipline. And I learned not a little from his own Exem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plary Conduct.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Another Remark they make, is on the Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berality of this General, and his Contempt of Riches: For he really impoveriſh'd himſelf to reward and gratify his Friends. It being a Word very common in his Mouth, <hi>That he would love on the King's Pay, and his Friends ſhould live on his Eſtate.</hi> Yet he was but
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:102965:46"/>a Younger Brother. Which made his Wife often ſay, <hi>That were it not for the King</hi>'s <hi>Mony, her Husband entertain'd ſuch a Reti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue of Noble Beggars about him, That ſhe fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed both he and ſhe muſt in a little Time, take up the ſame Trade, and turn Mendicants themſelves.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>It is credibly reported of this great Man, that he ſet his Heart ſo little on Mony, as not to know one Piece of Coin from another, nor their different Value in Exchange.</p>
                  <p>Once he was heard to ſay theſe words, to ſome of the Nobles who were diſcourſing on Wealth, <hi>I wonder,</hi> ſaid he, <hi>what pleaſure Me<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap> can take in hoarding up great Heaps of Mony: For my Part if at the End of the Year, I ſhould find in my Coffers, a great Treaſure of Gold left, it would Nauſeate me as much, as if juſt when I had made a full Dinner, I ſhould be forc'd to ſit ſtill, and glut my ſelf by eating of the ſame Diſhes over again.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And that which is moſt to be admir'd is, That even in his Old Age, to which Avarice is ſo Natural, his Purſe was always open, and he gave away his Mony as Liberally, as in his Youth. So that when he was Dead, they could find no more than Five Hundred Crowns in his Keeping. Beſides, he died much in Debt, which he Contracted on the Armies Account, that they ſhould not want their pay in due Seaſon. But, 'tis ſaid the <hi>King</hi> either has diſcharg'd theſe Debts or will do it in a little Time,</p>
                  <pb n="68" facs="tcp:102965:47"/>
                  <p>He was a Man of no great Preſence either for Tallneſs or graceful Features; being of an ordinary Size, and heavy Countenance. With a Mein and Air more like a Citizen or Mechanick, than a Souldier. Which juſtifies the old Proverb, <hi>That the Face is not always the True Index of the Heart.</hi> For all the World knows, that, <hi>he was a Man of Great Reſolution and Bravery.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>They attribute many of his Victories to his Regular and Sage Conduct; others to his Fortune; whilſt they cannot deny, That ſome were owing entirely to the Force of his In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincible Courage.</p>
                  <p>It were eaſie to relate many Inſtances of this kind. But, I will not tire thy Patience. My Letter is already ſtretch'd beyond its de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign'd Limits; yet it comes far ſhort of reach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Character of <hi>this Prince.</hi> However it would be Invidious not to inform thee of all I know concerning him, worth Obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
                  <p>In the Time of the Civil Wars, after he had abandon'd the Party of the Malecontents, and was made <hi>General</hi> of one of the <hi>King</hi>'s Armies, he gave an admirable proof of his undaunted Valour. For, when he had but Three Thouſand Five Hundred Men with him, and thoſe in a manner hemm'd in by Fourteen Thouſand of the Rebels; ſo that there was but one Paſs left, whereby he might eſcape, and he was ſtrongly preſs'd to make uſe of that advantage: <hi>No,</hi> ſays he, <hi>I will not any longer live to ſee my Soveraign ſhut out of
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:102965:47"/>his own Cities;</hi> Orleans <hi>barr'd her Gates againſt him, even whilſt the</hi> King's <hi>Forces were entire, before they had receiv'd any Loſs or Defeat, and can we expect they will any where be more favour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to him, when they ſhall behold us flying from our Victorious Enemies? No: This Fatal Day ſhall either put a Check to their Succeſs, or give a Period to my Life.</hi> And the Event anſwer'd his Expectation. For he enter'd into Battel with the <hi>Prince of Conde,</hi> and routed all his Forces. Ever ſince which, he has done the <hi>French King</hi> ſo many eminent Services, as Amply made Amends for his Two Years Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volt.</p>
                  <p>He is now gone to the other World, not as to a Campagne, but to Celebrate an Eternal Triumph among the Famous <hi>Heroes</hi> of the <hi>Earth.</hi> The <hi>King</hi> has in Honour of his Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits, caus'd his Body to be buried in the <hi>Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of St. Denis,</hi> where all the <hi>Blood Royal of France</hi> is repoſited. Shewing in this, how little difference he makes between him that ſits on the Throne, and him that well ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports it.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Illuſtrious Hamet,</hi> I pray <hi>Heaven</hi> inſpire the <hi>Sultan</hi> to reward thee and all his Faithful Miniſters, and <hi>Valiant Generals,</hi> with parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Honours, proportionate to every Mans diſtinct Merits, and Services. Adieu.</p>

                     <hi>To the</hi> Kaimacham.</head>
                  <p>THere happen many remarkable Events in a year, which I cannot preſently tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit an Account of, for want of Timely In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligence. My Letters are often finiſh'd and ſeal'd, and ſometimes ſent away before I hear of the Taking of ſuch a City, or Strong Hold; of this Victory on the <hi>French</hi> ſide, or that Succeſs on the Part of their Enemies, the <hi>Germans, Spaniards,</hi> and <hi>Hollanders.</hi> And I do not think it worth while to trouble the Miniſters of the <hi>Port</hi> with an After-Diſpatch, only to inform them of ſome Siege, Battel, or other petty Occurrence, as oft as they come to my knowledge. Chuſing rather to reca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitulate in one Letter, at the end of the year, all ſuch Paſſages as were omitted before, That ſo my Intelligence however diſ-joynted and parcel'd out into Fragments, may yet at laſt be ſet together again, and made entire.</p>
                  <p>Thus the taking of <hi>Bellegand</hi> in <hi>Rouſſillon</hi> from the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> by the <hi>Mareſchal de Schom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berg,</hi> was not a matter of that Importance as to deſerve a particular Letter on Purpoſe to keep Time with the Action. Yet it is conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient to inſert it in this Summary of Tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actions omitted in my former Letters; That ſo the <hi>Ottoman</hi> Regiſter may not be imperfect and defective. This Fortreſs was taken about
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:102965:48"/>
                     <hi>Midſummer,</hi> after an Entrenchment of Seven Days.</p>
                  <p>But Fortune though ſhe ſeems to have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clar'd in Favour of the <hi>French</hi> Arms, yet to ſhew her Inconſtancy, ſometimes turns her Smiles to Frowns, and ſeems for a While to leave them in the Lurch.</p>
                  <p>On the 11th. of the 8th. <hi>Moon,</hi> there hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen'd an Accident at <hi>Treves,</hi> which occaſion'd the Loſs of that Town to the Confederate Enemies of <hi>France,</hi> and a little clouded the Glory of the <hi>Mareſchal de Crequi</hi>'s Arms, who had hitherto Fought Succeſsfully, and gain'd the Reputation of a very Wiſe and Prudent General.</p>
                  <p>It ſeems the Governour of <hi>Treves,</hi> whom they call the <hi>Sieur Vignory</hi> had Orders to come out of the Town that very Day, and joyn the <hi>Mareſchal de Crequi</hi> with Five Thouſand Men of the Garriſon, to put in Execution ſome Deſign they had upon the Confederate Forces, which lay not far off. The Governour in Complyance with the Order, was Marching his Men over a Bridge, when his Horſe ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly ſtarting at the Diſcharge of a <hi>Piſtol</hi> fell with his Rider into the Ditch, where they both periſh'd. Now this unfortunate Gentleman not having diſcover'd his Secret Order to any Perſon Living; his Lieutenant being ignorant of the Deſign, and troubl'd at this unhappy Accident, caus'd the Five Thouſand Men to March back again into the Town. In the mean time the <hi>Mareſchal de Crejui</hi> in vain expected the coming of theſe Recruits,
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:102965:49"/>and finding himſelf too weak, to reſiſt the more numerous Troops of his Enemies, was forc'd to give Way, whilſt they advanc'd to beſiege the Town, the main Thing which he aim'd to prevent. In this Streight he had nothing elſe to do but to throw him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf with his Forces into the Town, that ſo his Preſence might ſupply the Dead Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernours Place, till the King's Pleaſure were known. He defended the Place with much Reſolution and Bravery: But by the Treach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ery of a certain Captain belonging to the Garriſon, it was at length taken, after A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundance of Bloodſhed. This Traitors Name was <hi>Boſejourdan;</hi> he held a private Correſpondence with the Enemy, inform'd them of the Diſadvantages the Town lay under; corrupted ſeveral of the Garriſon, and did all Things that might facilitate the Reduction of the Place. For which he was deſervedly hang'd, having been deliver'd in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Hands of the <hi>French,</hi> by thoſe; who, <hi>though they made uſe of the Treaſon, yet could not but abhor the Traytor.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Imperialiſts took Courage upon this Succeſs, and began to think, That ſince the Death of <hi>Mareſchal Turenne, Fortune had a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bandon'd the Intereſt of</hi> France, <hi>and enter'd into the Confederacy with them.</hi> Hereupon <hi>Count Montecueuli</hi> on the 20th of the 8th <hi>Moon</hi> inveſted <hi>Haguenau,</hi> a ſtrong Place in the Hands of the <hi>French.</hi> But the Appreach of the <hi>Prince</hi> of <hi>Conde</hi> ſoon made him raiſe the Siege. Since which there has been lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:102965:49"/>of Action on either Side, ſave the taking of <hi>Thuin,</hi> a Town ſituated on the <hi>Sambre,</hi> and which commands all the Country be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween that River and the <hi>Mouſe.</hi> It was ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>render'd to the <hi>French</hi> about the Beginning of the 11th. <hi>Moon,</hi> on Condition that the Priviledges of the Inhabitants ſhould be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerv'd, and that they ſhould not be forc'd to maintain the <hi>King</hi>'s Garriſon.</p>
                  <p>There have been lately ſome Seditions in the <hi>Provinces</hi> of <hi>Bretagne</hi> and <hi>Guienne,</hi> ſaid to be ſecretly abetted by the Parliaments of <hi>Bourdeaux</hi> and <hi>Rennes.</hi> For which the <hi>King</hi> has ſignifyed his Diſpleaſure by removing thoſe Aſſemblies to other Places, after ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving inflicted ſevere and exemplary Puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments on the Ring-leaders of the Tumults.</p>
                  <p>And now this Monarch ſeems to be weary of the Fatigues of War, having publiſh'd a <hi>Manifeſto, wherein he complains of the Inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry done to</hi> Prince William of Furſtemberg, <hi>Ple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nipotentiary from the</hi> Biſhop <hi>of</hi> Cologne; <hi>Declares that he had reaſon to ſhew his Reſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of an Affront given to his Allie, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to the Law of Nature; that neverthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs he had labour'd for the general Peace of</hi> Chriſtendom: <hi>And was now in the ſame In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clination.</hi> On which Account he ſent the <hi>Sieur Colbert</hi> Maſter of the Requeſts, and the <hi>Count d' Avaux</hi> to <hi>Nimeguen</hi> there to aſſiſt at the Conferences of Peace.</p>
                  <p>Some ſay this Propenſion to Peace is the Effect of a Vow the <hi>King</hi> made, when he was lately afflicted with a violent Fever.
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:102965:50"/>Be it how it will, the Captains and Soldi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers on all Sides are agreed to ceaſe from Acts of Hoſtility, during this cold Seaſon: finding it much more comfortable to wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low in Beds of Down, than to lief abroad in the Snow; and to lay cloſe Siege to a good Fire, than to campagne it in Trench<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es full of Water and Ice.</p>

                  <p>IF I write often to the <hi>Baſſa</hi>'s of the <hi>Land,</hi> I do not forget the Duty I owe to <hi>him</hi> of the <hi>Sea.</hi> Only that Element has not been the Stage of ſo many Remarkable Actions as the other: There are no Forts, Caſtles, or ſtrong Cities, built upon the Waves: No ſettled Camps, or formal Sieges, unleſs it be upon the Frozen Seas, within or near the <hi>Artick Circle.</hi> And there they only imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate the Trade of War to exerciſe their Youth.</p>
                  <p>However, on the other Parts of the O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cean, there are flying Campagnes, Battels <hi>en Paſſant;</hi> and this Year has afforded ſome Marine Engagements between the <hi>French, Hollanders,</hi> and <hi>Spaniards,</hi> not altogether un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy of thy Knowledge.</p>
                  <p>On the 8th. of the 1 ſt. <hi>Moon,</hi> there hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened a Naval Fight between the <hi>Sieur de Queſne,</hi> Lieutenant General of the <hi>French Fleets,</hi> and <hi>de Ruiter</hi> Vice-Admiral of the <hi>Dutch.</hi> Wherein the later ſuffer'd conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable Damage.

                  <p>It was not far from the Old dangerous Streight between <hi>Charybdis</hi> and <hi>Scylla,</hi> where the <hi>Duke de Vivonne</hi> deſcry'd the Hoſtile Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vies making toward the Place where he lay with his Fleet at Anchor.

The <hi>Spaniards</hi> and <hi>Hollanders</hi> had Tewenty Seven Ships of <hi>War,</hi> Nineteen Gallies, and Four Fire Ships. The <hi>French</hi> had but Nineteen Ships of War, Seven Gallies, and Five Fire Ships. Theſe got the Wind of their Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, and attacqu'd them ſo fiercely, that they drove ſeveral of their Capital Veſſels on thoſe dangerous Rocks and Sands, where they were loſt; and they burnt Thirteen more of their Beſt Ships, among which were the Admiral of <hi>Spain,</hi> and the Vice-Admiral of <hi>Holland.</hi>

                  <p>THere is no Man in this Mortal Life, who has not chang'd his Opinions one Time or other. And whether it be an Argument of Wiſdom or Folly, Knowledge or Igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, to be thus Mutable in our Thoughts; we find few tenacious in their <hi>Old Age,</hi> of the Notions they entertain'd in their <hi>Youth.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>We have ſome Natural and <hi>Proleptick I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dens</hi> born with us; others impos'd upon us by our Parents, Nurſes and Tutors. Our Infant Fancies are tender, flexible, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptive of any Impreſſions; like Gold that

So in the <hi>Mint</hi> of Human Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation, our Thoughts are molded and form'd, by each prevailing <hi>Genius</hi> that keeps us Company.

                  <p>Whether it be an Effect of this General Weakneſs in Human Nature, or of my own particular Inconſtancy; or in fine, of more correct and mature Conſideration, I will not determine. But this I am ſure of, That I cannot think now of ſeveral things, as I have done formerly, without offering great Violence to my preſent Reaſon.

                  <p>ABout five Years ago I ſent thee a <hi>Diſpatch,</hi> containing an Account of the kind Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception thy <hi>Doctrins</hi> found in <hi>Europe,</hi> and of the ſwift Progreſs they made in Converting the honeſter ſort of <hi>Nazarenes.</hi> I alſo ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted thee with the Oppoſition that was made againſt the Writings of <hi>Francis Male<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vella,</hi> by the <hi>Jeſuits</hi> and <hi>Dominicans.</hi> Now I ſhall inform thee farther of the prodigious Advances this <hi>Sacred Inſtitution of Life</hi> his made in <hi>Italy, France,</hi> and <hi>Spain,</hi> with <hi>Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>many,</hi> and other Regions in the Weſt.</p>
                  <p>There is an eminent Man in <hi>Rome,</hi> whom they call Father <hi>Petrucci,</hi> a Perſon of great Learning, and conſpicuous Knowledge. His Piety indeed has been by him induſtriouſly concealed, as much as lay in's Power: But yet his moſt recluſe good Works took Air, and all Men of Integrity conceive a Venera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion for him. He having read the Works of <hi>Malevella,</hi> grew enamour'd of ſo ſublime a Syſtem of ſpiritual Rules; and wrote to all his Friends by way of Recommendation of the Author and his Subject. Thoſe Letters afterwards were put in Print, and 'tis not to be expreſt, what powerful Influence they had
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:102965:59"/>on all impartial Readers. He publiſhed alſo many learned Treatiſes, in the Defence and Praiſe of a Contemplative Life. And the Reputation of this refin'd <hi>Theology</hi> daily en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creas'd, and ſpread abroad in every Corner of the Chriſtian World.</p>
                  <p>Among the reſt of learned Proſelytes, a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain <hi>Spaniſh Prieſt,</hi> and <hi>Doctor</hi> of the <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Law,</hi> whom they call <hi>Michael de Molino,</hi> appear'd upon the <hi>Stage;</hi> and the laſt Year publiſh'd a comprehenſive Treatiſe of Myſtical Religion. The Book was approv'd and Licens'd by the Archbiſhop of <hi>Rheggio,</hi> by the General of the <hi>Franciſcans,</hi> an Officer of the <hi>Inquiſition,</hi> and by <hi>Martin de Eſparſa,</hi> an eminent <hi>Jeſuit</hi> belonging to the ſame Court, and Profeſſor of <hi>Theology</hi> at <hi>Rome.</hi> The Preſs had no ſooner deliver'd this myſterious Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſe to the World, but every body catch'd it up. So that the firſt Edition being ſoon diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſed in <hi>Rome, Ferrara, Naples,</hi> and other Cities of <hi>Italy,</hi> it was neceſſary to ſtart a new Impreſſion of ſo acceptable a Thing, that the remaining Provinces, States, and Principali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, might not want their ſhare of ſo <hi>divine</hi> a Copy; That <hi>Spain</hi> might be reformed by one of her own Natives; and <hi>Generous France</hi> forgetting her Averſions, might not diſdain the ſage Inſtructions of a hated <hi>Spaniard.</hi> In a word, <hi>Molino</hi>'s Book is had in ſecond Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration with the <hi>Goſpel.</hi> His Friendſhip is coveted by the greateſt Men in <hi>Rome;</hi> eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally the Secular Clergy are ambitious to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm the Honours, Dignities, and Benefices
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:102965:60"/>they already poſſeſs i'th' Church, by gaining the Favour of his Acquaintance. They con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſult him as an Oracle in knotty <hi>Problems</hi> of <hi>Divinity;</hi> and many <hi>Cardinals</hi> court his Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſpondence, not valuing their Rank in the Red Liſt of Eccleſiaſtical Princes, unleſs they are alſo enrolled in the happy Number of <hi>Molino</hi>'s Friends; ſuch are <hi>Carpegna, Azolini, Caſſanta, Odeſcalchi,</hi> and the <hi>French</hi> Cardinal <hi>D'Eſtrees.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This laſt is famous for his Learning and Accompliſhments, being Educated in the <hi>Sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bonne,</hi> and a Familiar of Monſieur <hi>De Lumay</hi> a great Reformer of Errors in the Doctrin and Diſcipline of the <hi>Roman</hi> Church. Being thus prediſpos'd to favor any one who wou'd expoſe himſelf to ſtem the Torrent of Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptions, the Tide of vain and ſuperſtitious Practices, advancing daily higher and higher, and threatning to overflow the Banks of ſolid Piety, ſincere Devotion, and all Moral Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue, the Generous <hi>Cardinal</hi> appeared the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Patron of <hi>Molino,</hi> and in private they had many Conferences. The <hi>Spaniard</hi> laid aſide his Native Jealouſie of Foreigners, and the <hi>Frenchman</hi> mortified his Pique againſt that Nation. They both convers'd with openneſs of Heart, and unreſerved Freedom.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Cardinal</hi> alſo, after this, brought him acquainted with ſeveral Eminent Men in <hi>France,</hi> between whom and <hi>Molino</hi> was held a ſtrict Intelligence. The new <hi>Pope,</hi> who was before called Cardinal <hi>Odeſcalchi,</hi> has gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven him an Apartment in his own Palace, and
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:102965:60"/>done him many other Honours. In a word, he is grown ſo conſiderable, that the greateſt part of <hi>Nazarenes</hi> look upon him as <hi>a Prophet ſint from God.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I take Complacency to ſee <hi>Mahometaniſm</hi> thus maſquerade it in the Heart of <hi>Chriſten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom;</hi> and the moſt refined Draught of our Religion copied in the Lives and Practices of the moſt Excellent among the <hi>Nazarenes.</hi> 'Tis a fair Sign, methinks, that by degrees they will enquire a little farther, and with more Humility, into our Sacred Law; that they will not ſtumble at Circumciſion. Waſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and other Purifications and Ceremonies appointed by the <hi>Prophet;</hi> ſince they are all performed in Honour of the <hi>eternal <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nity,</hi> and not to Images or Pictures. However at leaſt, ſuch pious and contemplative Men as theſe, will, by a neceſſary Conſequence, raiſe up a ſecret Faction for us, and qualifie the bitter Zeal and Spight which Chriſtians ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally bear againſt the <hi>True Believers.</hi> For the Followers of <hi>Malevella, Petrucci,</hi> and <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lino,</hi> are already branded, and diſtinguiſh'd from the reſt of the <hi>Nazarenes,</hi> by the odious Names of <hi>Hereticks,</hi> which is next door to the more opprobrious Title of <hi>Infidels,</hi> the beſt and kindeſt <hi>Epithet</hi> they can afford the <hi>faithful Muſſulmans.</hi>
                  </p>

                  <p>They brought with them, Rules and Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dels of <hi>Divine</hi> Architecture, that the <hi>Dormi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory</hi> of the <hi>Meſſenger</hi> of <hi>God</hi> might be maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtick and glorious.

                  <p>THE <hi>French</hi> are reſolv'd to make bold Eſſorts this <hi>Campaign,</hi> to repair the Loſs of <hi>Philipsburg,</hi> which was taken from them laſt Year. The <hi>King</hi> is impatient of any Check given to the Progreſs of his Arms, and ſpares neither Men nor Mony to keep up the Reputation and Fame of a <hi>Conqueror.</hi> And if this Character (grown familiar to him, as it were by Preſcription, after a long and almoſt uninterrupted Series of Victories) hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen'd at any Time to be leſſens by ſom<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

                  </p>
                  <p>He has many and great Armies in Pay; and whether it be an Effect of his Fortune, or his Judgment, 'tis obſerv'd, that he is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways bleſs'd with the Ableſt Generals in <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtendom.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Firſt Thing he enterpriz'd was the Siege of <hi>Valenciennes,</hi> a City ſeated on the Frontiers of the <hi>Spaniſh Netherlands;</hi> a very important Place, and conſiderable for us Commerce; inhabited alſo by a Stout, War<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like People; and of very difficult Acceſs, by
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:102965:65"/>reaſon of a certain River, with whoſe Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters they can at Pleaſure drown all the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try round about. It was inveſted by the <hi>Duke</hi> of <hi>Luxemburg</hi> on the 28th of the 2d <hi>Moon,</hi> and formally beſieg'd on the 4th of the 3d. On the 17th there was a General Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſault given, and the <hi>French</hi> enter'd the Town; which ſo terrified the Inhabitants, that they threw themſelves upon the King's Mercy. He accepted their Submiſſions, and ſo put a Stop to the common Violence in ſuch Caſes.</p>
                  <p>Another Time this had been enough to have Crown'd a whole <hi>Campaign,</hi> and ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fy'd the Ambition of the <hi>French</hi> Generals; but now, the Remembrance of laſt Year's Loſs and Diſgrace, ſpurs them on to New Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venges: And to convince the World that this <hi>Monarch</hi> is not eaſily to be daunted, but that he is jealous of his Glory, he has, ſince the Taking of <hi>Valenciennes,</hi> beſieg'd two Strong Cities, <hi>Cambray</hi> and <hi>St. Omers.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Former of theſe, is eſteem'd one of the ſtrongeſt Places in all <hi>Flanders;</hi> it is ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuated on the River <hi>Eſcaut,</hi> and was the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Patrimony of the <hi>French</hi> Crown, ever ſince the Reign of <hi>Clodion</hi> II. <hi>King</hi> of <hi>France,</hi> who made himſelf Maſter of it in the Year 445 of the <hi>Chriſtians Hegira.</hi> Afterwards it fell to the Share of <hi>Charles the Bald,</hi> in the Year 843; and in the Year 870, it became the Occaſion of a War between the <hi>Kings</hi> of <hi>France,</hi> the <hi>Emperors,</hi> and the <hi>Counts</hi> of <hi>Flan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders.</hi> In which Conteſt, one of the <hi>Baldwins</hi> got it, and left it to his Son. But <hi>Charles</hi> V.
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:102965:65"/>over-reach'd him; and, by Means of the <hi>Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop</hi>'s Correſpondence, took Poſſeſſion of the Place. He put a Strong Garriſon in it, and built a Cittadel which render'd the Town almoſt Impregnable. In proceſs of Time it fell into the Hands of the <hi>Duke</hi> of <hi>Alanſon,</hi> Brother to <hi>Henry</hi> III. when he was made <hi>Count</hi> of <hi>Flanders,</hi> in the Year 1582. But in the Year 1595. the <hi>Spaniards</hi> took it, and have held it ever ſince, till the 6th of the 4th <hi>Moon</hi> of this preſent Year; when the Gates were ſet open, to let in the <hi>French</hi> Troops; and the 17th, the Cittadel was ſurrender'd upon Articles.</p>
                  <p>As for <hi>St. Omers,</hi> it is a Great City, and well fortified; having on One Side the River <hi>Aa,</hi> with its Mariſhes; and on the Other, being defended by a Caſtle, flank'd with good Baſtions, and encompaſs'd with an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tream broad and deep Ditch. About the Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of this <hi>Moon</hi> it was inveſted by the <hi>French King</hi>'s Forces, and within three or four Days it was formally Beſieg'd, but not gain'd without a Bloody Combat, fought be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the <hi>French</hi> and the <hi>Prince</hi> of <hi>Orange,</hi> who came with a Conſiderable Army, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigning to throw Succours into the Place. I will not trouble thee, by Reciting all the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars of the Fight; only be aſſur'd, that the <hi>French</hi> got the Victory, put the Others to Flight, remain'd Maſters of the Field, took Thirteen Pieces of Cannon, Seventeen Stan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dards, all the Enemy's Baggage, and almoſt Three Thouſand Priſoners.</p>
                  <pb n="106" facs="tcp:102965:66"/>
                  <p>The Stage of this great Action was a Place call'd <hi>Mont-Caſſel,</hi> not far from <hi>St. Omers:</hi> A Spot of Ground obſerv'd to have once before been Propitious to the <hi>French</hi> Arms, when <hi>Philip</hi> of <hi>Valois</hi> fought there with the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> and gave 'em an entire Defeat. He was rec. kon'd the <hi>Valianteſt Prince</hi> of that Age.</p>
                  <p>The Inhabitants of <hi>St. Omers</hi> hearing of the Defeat that was given to the <hi>Prince</hi> of <hi>Orange,</hi> were in ſo great a Conſternation, that in few Days they voluntarily ſurrender'd to the <hi>French King.</hi>

He is an Excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent Pay-maſter; and never gives Occaſion for his Soldiers to Repine or Murmur for want of their Daily Allowance, nor puts them upon impatient Expectations of their Arrears. On the Contrary, He is very Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nificent and Liberal to all Men of Merit: And the meaneſt Soldier, who ſignalizes him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf by any Notable Exploit, or Action of Bravery, is ſure to be diſtinguiſh'd from the Reſt by ſome Royal Reward in Mony, if he be not advanc'd to the Dignity of a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mander: And ſometimes they are honour'd with both. This Conduct makes his Men fight like Lyons, each being Emulous of his Fellows, and all freely hazarding their Lives, to gain their Maſter's Eſteem; counting that the moſt Glorious Poſt, which is moſt expos'd to Danger.</p>

                  <p>THE Love of Women is Natural to our Sex; and there is no Man, who, at one Time or other, has not felt the Warmths of this Amorous Paſſion. But, it is ſtrange to obſerve, after what a different Manner this Flame diſcovers it ſelf in People of Various Nations, Ages, Qualities, Fortunes and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitutions. <hi>Young Men</hi> are Laſcivious and Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent in their Love: <hi>Old Men</hi> Ridiculous, and Formal. The <hi>Poor Man</hi> ſtudies to pleaſe his Miſtreſs by Abject Submiſſions, and Humble Obſequiouſneſs. The <hi>Rich</hi> ſtrives to, win her by Munificent Gifts and Preſents. The <hi>Vul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar</hi> make their Court by Feaſting the Coy Damſel, and Regaling her with Junkets and Wine. The Noble entertain her with Plays, Maſquerades, Ballets, and other Pompous Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertiſements.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Ingenious Italian</hi> ſets upon his Miſtreſs with a kind of Poliſh'd Wantonneſs; not ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king Romantick, Whining Addreſſes; but, with a Refin'd Impudence, his Eyes, his Hands, his Tongue, and all his Actions, ſoon make her ſenſible where his Pain lies. He celebrates her Praiſes in Verſe, and hires Muſick to <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>renade</hi>
                     <pb n="109" facs="tcp:102965:67"/>her. Finally, He never leaves till he Gains her, or Revenges himſelf on his Rival, by Sending him, out of the World: And on her, by Turning all his Compliments into Curſes and Slanders. But if he gets her, he ſhuts her up for ever, and makes her Cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber her Priſon.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Headſtrong Spaniard,</hi> burning with De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire, and impatient of Delay, ſtung with <hi>Reſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs Concupiſcence,</hi> behaves himſelf like a Mad-Man: He ſtamps, ſtares, and raves; walks furiouſly backward and forward, rolls his Eyes after a hideous Manner; he ſtarts, ſtands ſtill, lais his Hand upon his Sword, looks up to <hi>Heaven,</hi> invokes the <hi>Saints,</hi> talks to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, threatens the Diſſolution of all Things, if he be balk'd of his <hi>Love.</hi> In this Humour he runs to his <hi>Miſtreſs,</hi> falls at her Feet, makes Doleful and Paſſionate Complaints, throws himſelf upon her Mercy, adores her, and does all Things which are proper for a Deſperate Lover. If by this Means he enjoy her, he ſoon grows weary of her, and either kills her, or proſtitutes her ſecretly for Gold. But if he cannot obtain her, then he macerates and tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments himſelf, and is reſolv'd to Die.</p>
                  <p>Different from both theſe is the <hi>Wanton French-man,</hi> who courts his <hi>Miſtreſs</hi> after a Jolly Faſhion, with Songs, Dances, Muſick and Jeſts. He is all Life and Mirth when in her Company, and abounds with a Thouſand Sorts of Comical Humours. If he gets her, after a little Time the Fickle Spark is cloy'd, and Falls in Love with Another. If he fail of
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:102965:68"/>his Purpoſe, he is not much Concern'd; for all his <hi>Love</hi> was but Counterfeit: Yet he makes a Shew of Diſcontent, he threatens, and ſput<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters at her for a While; but this <hi>Tongue-Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peſt</hi> is ſoon laid, and a new Face produces a Calm.</p>
                  <p>But the <hi>Flegmatick German</hi> is very hard to be kindl'd up to this Paſſion, and then needs a great deal of Art to blow him into a Flame. He is Cold and Wary, Thoughtful and Slow, Provident and Dull: Yet, when once touch'd with this Affection, he is very Liberal of his Gifts, which is the Maſter-piece of his Court<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip. If he obtains his <hi>Miſtreſs,</hi> he ſoon re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turns to his Primitive Frigidity: And if he be fruſtrated, he is but where he was; far from Killing himſelf for a Peeviſh Female.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>French-man</hi> profeſſes more Love than he has: The <hi>German</hi> endeavours to hide the Fervour of his Paſſion: The <hi>Spaniard</hi> per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuades himſelf, that he is Belov'd by his Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreſs; Whilſt the <hi>Italian</hi> takes the neareſt Courſe to be Belov'd by her in Reality.

                  <p>There is no Nation free from the Senti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of Love: Yet every Age and Region vary in their Conduct toward Women. Here in the <hi>Weſt,</hi> they are all for Intriguing and Gallantry. They accuſe the <hi>Muſſulmans</hi> for having more Wives than one, and for Keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing as many Concubines as they pleaſe; whilſt they themſelves have their Wives almoſt in Common, and Lie with every Wench that comes in their Way. <hi>Adultery</hi> paſſes with 'em for Good Breeding, and <hi>Fornication</hi> is eſteem'd as Innocent an Action as Eating and Drinking: Whereas thou know'ſt, among the <hi>True Believers,</hi> theſe Crimes are puniſh'd with <hi>Death. Promiſcuous Copulation</hi> was forbid by <hi>Moyſes, Jeſus,</hi> and <hi>Mahomet;</hi> and, in General,
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:102965:69"/>by all the <hi>Prophets.</hi> It is a ſufficient Indul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence, That every Man may Marry four Wives, and enjoy as many other Women as he either Takes Captives from the Enemy in Wars, or purchaſes with his Mony. But theſe <hi>Infidels</hi> had rather follow the Sentiments of the Old <hi>Heathen Law-givers,</hi> and the Exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples of <hi>Idolatrous Nations,</hi> than obey <hi>God</hi> and his <hi>Meſſengers.</hi> They applaud <hi>Solon,</hi> the Great Law-giver of the <hi>Athenians,</hi> calling him a <hi>Wiſe Man,</hi> as he was plonounc'd by the <hi>Del<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phick Oracle; and a Generous Patriot, for pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curing Harlots to accompany the Youths of the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and building a Temple to</hi> Venus <hi>out of the Mony they got by Proſtituting themſelves.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>'Tis certain, Whores were much eſteem'd in thoſe Days, among the <hi>Graecians:</hi> For the Magiſtrates built them Publick Houſes on purpoſe, and free for all Comers: They alſo made Laws, to protect them from Injuries. And ſo great was the Veneration that Beſot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted People had for them, that when <hi>Perſes</hi> invaded <hi>Greece,</hi> the <hi>Harlots</hi> of <hi>Corinth</hi> under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>took to intercede for their Country, in the Temple of <hi>Venus.</hi> Nay, whatſoever Extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary Favour they had to ask of that <hi>God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſs,</hi> it was done by the Mediation of the Whores. And there ſeems ſome Reaſon on their Side, ſince <hi>Venus</hi> her ſelf was Tranſlated to <hi>Heaven,</hi> and made a <hi>Goddeſs,</hi> for being the Greateſt Whore and Bawd that ever liv'd.

                  <pb n="113" facs="tcp:102965:69"/>
                  <p>What a Work did <hi>Aſpaſia</hi> make, who fill'd all <hi>Greece</hi> with Whores? For the Love of her, and her Wenches, it was, that <hi>Pericles</hi> begun the <hi>Peloponeſian</hi> War, that laſted ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Years, and is ſo much talk'd of in Ancient Hiſtory. There were alſo Learned Whores; as, <hi>Sappho,</hi> the Miſtreſs of <hi>Phaon, Sempronia, Leaena,</hi> and <hi>Leontium:</hi> Who wrote publickly in Vindication of their Lewd Practice, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veigh'd againſt <hi>Marriage.</hi> There were alſo Noble Whores; as, <hi>Rhodope,</hi> who built one of the <hi>Egyptian Pyramids</hi> with the Mony given her by the <hi>King. Thais</hi> the <hi>Corinthian,</hi> who was ſo ſurpaſſing Beautiful, that ſhe ſcorn'd to Lie with any but <hi>Kings</hi> and <hi>Princes.</hi> But <hi>Meſſalina,</hi> the Wife of <hi>Claudius Caeſar,</hi> exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed them all in the <hi>Salaciouſneſs</hi> of her Temper. I will not omit to mention <hi>Joan, Queen</hi> of <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples,</hi> who caus'd her Firſt Husband to be hang'd becauſe he could not ſatisfle her Luſt. His Name was <hi>Andrew,</hi> Son to <hi>Elizabeth, Quen</hi> of <hi>Hungary.</hi> Her Second Husband, to repair the Fault of the Firſt, ſo waſted his Strength in the Conjugal Embraces, that in a little Time he kill'd himſelf. Her Third Huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band was <hi>James King</hi> of <hi>Majorca,</hi> whom ſhe Beheaded for Lying with another Woman. Her Fourth and Laſt Spouſe was <hi>Otho Duke</hi> of <hi>Brunſwick:</hi> He liv'd to ſee her hang'd in the ſame Place where her Firſt Husband had, by her Order, ſuffer'd the ſame Fate. This was the Revenge of <hi>Charles Prince</hi> of <hi>Dyra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chium,</hi> Couſin-German to <hi>Andrew</hi> before-men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion'd. This <hi>Laſcivious Queen</hi> would have

                  <p>What ſhall I ſay of <hi>Semiram is, Empreſs</hi> of the <hi>Aſſyrians?</hi> Of <hi>Paſiphae,</hi> Wife to <hi>Minos King</hi> of <hi>Crete;</hi> or of an Hundred other <hi>Royal Whores?</hi> When it is obſervable, that the moſt <hi>Illuſtrious Heroes</hi> on Earth have ſprung from <hi>Adulterous Beds.</hi> Witneſs <hi>Hercules, Alexan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, Clodoveus King</hi> of the <hi>Franks, Theodoric</hi> the <hi>Goth, William</hi> the <hi>Norman, Raymir</hi> of <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragon;</hi> and many more, too tedious to be recited. Nay, few <hi>Kings</hi> or <hi>Princes</hi> are born of Lawful Mothers.</p>
                  <p>Doubtleſs, the <hi>Infidel</hi> Nations live in great Corruption of Manners; they confound and blend together <hi>Divine</hi> and <hi>Profane</hi> Maxims; from whence reſult Monſtrous and Abomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Practices, and a General Uncleanneſs of Life in all Things. But the Chaſte Followers of <hi>Mahomet</hi> have all Cuſtoms in Abomination, that deſile the <hi>Soul,</hi> and rob it of its Native Purity.

                     <hi>To the</hi> Captain Baſſa.</head>
                  <p>BY Ships newly arriv'd from <hi>America,</hi> Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice is brought to this Court of a ſignal Defeat given to a Squadron of <hi>Dutch</hi> Ships in thoſe Parts, and of the Taking the <hi>Iſle Taba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>go</hi> by the <hi>French.</hi> This Exploit was perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med under the Conduct of the Count <hi>D'Eſtrees,</hi> an <hi>Admiral</hi> of riſing Fame here in the <hi>West.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But, in my Opinion, the <hi>French</hi> magnifie this Emerprize beyond its true Value: for they loſt as many Ships and Men as the <hi>Hol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>landers;</hi> and all the Gain they can boaſt of is, a Place which will coſt them more to De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend than 'tis really worth.</p>
                  <p>I wonder this potent <hi>Monarch</hi> does not ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſet out a Fleet of Ships well Mann'd, and provided of all Neceſſaries, to make ſome Diſcoveries in that vaſt Tract of Land, cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led by <hi>Geographers,</hi> the <hi>Southern <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nknown World.</hi> It runs along from <hi>East</hi> to <hi>West,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the <hi>Tropick</hi> of <hi>Capricorn,</hi> and the <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tartick Circle;</hi> taking up the whole <hi>Southern Temperate Zone,</hi> or at leaſt the greateſt part of it. There have been many fabulous Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations of that diſtant Part of the <hi>Globe.</hi> Some of the Antients mention'd it, and modern Writers have utter'd various Conjectures
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:102965:71"/>about it. One will have it to be the Original <hi>Paradiſe</hi> of <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Eve.</hi> Another ſuppoſes it to be the Place whither the <hi>Ten Tribes</hi> of <hi>Iſraelites</hi> retir'd, that were carried away Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives by <hi>Salmanaſſar,</hi> King of <hi>Aſſyria.</hi> Which has occaſion'd ſo many Diſputes and Contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſies between different Hiſtorians.</p>
                  <p>Be it how it will, the delightful Situation of that Quarter, has given perhaps Encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement for ſuch kind of Thoughts: which I ſhould think, were alſo Invitation ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent to draw thither the Arms of ſome mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nanimous Prince; beſides the pure Novelty of the Deſign, and the Glory of making a Deſcent and Conqueſt, where no Mortals of our known World had ever ſet Foot before: Surely they are not afraid that it is enchant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Ground, or that they ſhall encounter an Army of Devils at their firſt Landing; that they ſhall be trepann'd into hidden Snares of Magick, or be ſurpris'd by ſome Infernal Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buſh. What fatal Timorouſneſs, what pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nick Suſpicion is it that renders <hi>Potentates</hi> of the Earth thus ingloriouſly prudent, and wretchedly cautious, to ſpare their Men, their Ships, and Mony, when ſo noble an Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taking ſeems to challenge their Courage, and awaken their utmoſt Reſolution, to combat a few Difficulties, which being once vanquiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, Eternal Honour and Renown follow?</p>
                  <p>What Diſcouragements, Lets, and Obſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles, did not the brave <hi>Columbus</hi> meet with, when he ſought the Aſſiſtance of ſeveral <hi>Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces</hi> and <hi>States,</hi> to ſet him out to Sea, that he
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:102965:72"/>might diſcover the then unknown <hi>Weſtern World?</hi> How coldly was his Project enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained at <hi>Genoua,</hi> his own Native Country? and at laſt, after long waiting, utterly reje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted? No better Reception found he in the Court of <hi>England,</hi> though a Nation claiming the firſt Rank among Sea-faring People. What Fatigues did he not undergo in travel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling up and down by Sea and Land from one Kingdom and Country to another? Neither reſted he, till he had accompliſh'd his Deſire, and procur'd Veſſels, Men, and Mony, from the King of <hi>Spain,</hi> to carry on his Enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſe.</p>
                  <p>Yet he had no other Ground to believe there was any Unknown Continent beyond the <hi>Atlantick Sea,</hi> ſave his own Conjecture, ſtarted from the Obſervations he had made on the Courſe of the Sun, and the Inequality of the known part of the Earth, compar'd with the vaſt Body of Waters which muſt be ſuppos'd neceſſary to make up an entire Globe, if there were not ſome Unknown Land extant to ſupply their Room, and prevent a <hi>Vacuum</hi> in Nature. For he conſider'd, that though this unequal ballancing of the Globe might paſs Muſter in the School of <hi>Natural Philoſophy,</hi> yet it cou'd not anſwer the ſtrict Scrutiny of the <hi>Mathematicks:</hi> But that there muſt be an even Counterpoiſe of Earth and Water, to keep this Ball faſt in its <hi>Vortex,</hi> and regular in its Circulation. So that this Great Man, built all his well-pitch'd and hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py Deſign upon a bare <hi>Geometrical</hi> Speculati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on:
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:102965:72"/>whereas there is evident Matter of Fact, the Teſtimony of many Authentick Eye-wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes to prove, that there is ſuch a Land as what I have been ſpeaking of, and all that ever paſs'd the <hi>Megellanick Streights</hi> muſt have ſeen it if they were not blind.</p>
                  <p>I counſel thee therefore, <hi>Mighty Baſſa,</hi> to repreſent theſe Things effectually to the <hi>Grand Signior:</hi> It will be no Diſgrace if he hearken not to thy Propoſals. Shew him the Eaſineſs of the Undertaking, if a ſmall Fleet be fitted up and ſent by Way of the <hi>Red Sea,</hi> to make Diſcoveries toward the <hi>South.</hi> Let them be well Mann'd and Victuall'd; provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded alſo with all ſorts of Arms and Ammu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nition in order to a Deſcent; with Materials and Inſtruments to raiſe a Fortreſs, if there be Occaſion. 'Tis a thouſand to one, if the Inhabitants of thoſe Unknown Regions have ever found out the Uſe of Guns; which will be a prodigious Advantage on our Side. The very Thunder of the <hi>Muſſulman Artillery,</hi> will terrifie them into Obedience. They will ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Surrender, as to <hi>Gods;</hi> or fly, as from <hi>Devils,</hi> leaving all the Maritime Coaſts to the Invaders Poſſeſſion.

                  <p>I Am convinc'd by long and manifold Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience, That <hi>God</hi> and the World, and eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Thing appear to Man in what Figure he pleaſes. We may make our own Opticks, though the Generality of Men take up with thoſe which are prepar'd for them by their Fathers and Tutors.

We adhere to the Opinions we received in our Infancy, with a partial Stiffneſs and Pride, that we may not ſeem to call in que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion the Wiſdom of our Anceſtors, or ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear wavering or inconſtant our Selves. So the <hi>Chriſtian Gallants</hi> ſwallow down whole Dozens of venomous Oyſters, without ſaying <hi>Grace;</hi> only becauſe 'tis the mode: Though they will not venture on a Cruſt of wholſome
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:102965:73"/>Bread, without conjuring a Bleſſing on it, by making the <hi>Sign of the Croſs,</hi> and ſquinting two or three magical Glances at <hi>Heaven,</hi> ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conded by <hi>Hocus-Pocus-Whiſpers,</hi> to compleat the <hi>Charm.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But let thou and I be more rational in our Principles and Practice. There is no <hi>God</hi> that will be banter'd with vain <hi>Mummery,</hi> or by Muſick be melodiouſly wheadl'd out of his <hi>Eternal Reaſon;</hi> no <hi>Incenſe</hi> can be of Proof to Noſe the Senſe of the <hi>Omniſcient,</hi> nor the moſt elegant Words delude <hi>him, who is perfect in Knowledge.</hi> He takes no Delight in the pompous Addreſſes of the Great, nor is he to be mov'd by the multitude of Solemn Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies. All that he requires of Man is, <hi>a Heart conform to the Divine Will, and Actions void of Offence.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But the Lawgivers and Governours of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions obſerving, That there was a certain Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious Fear and Reverence of ſome Divine Power, as it were planted in the Natures of all Men; and conſidering that this might be improv'd, with good Management, to the Advantage and Intereſt of the Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth; they invented ſet Forms of Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline, and exteriour Offices of Worſhip, which they term'd Holy Rites and Myſteries. Theſe they fortified with ſevere Laws and Sanctions, inflicting grievous Penalties on the Contemners of the Publick Service perform'd to the <hi>Gods.</hi> So <hi>Hermes Triſmegiſtus</hi> firſt taught the <hi>Egyptians; Meliſſus</hi> the <hi>Foſter-Father</hi> of <hi>Jupiter,</hi> inſtructed the Inhabitants
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:102965:74"/>of <hi>Crete; Faunus</hi> and <hi>Janus,</hi> the <hi>Latins; Nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ma Pompilius,</hi> the <hi>Romans; Orpheus,</hi> the <hi>Gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cians;</hi> or, as ſome ſay, <hi>Cadmus</hi> the Son of <hi>Agenor,</hi> firſt inſtructed that Nation in the Solemnities which were counted <hi>Divine,</hi> and which he himſelf learn'd in <hi>Phoenicia.</hi> He in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtituted the Conſecration of Images and Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues, the Burning of Incenſe, the Building of Temples and Altars, with the Hymns, Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifices, and other magnificent Rites, by which they honour'd the Powers Above.</p>
                  <p>Now that all this Religious Pageantry was eſtabliſh'd only for the Ends of Policy and State, is evident from hence, That the Chief Magiſtrates took the Liberty of making what <hi>Gods</hi> they pleas'd; and of encreaſing or di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſhing their Number at Diſcretion. So that in Proceſs of Time there were reckon'd no leſs than Thirty Thouſand <hi>Gods</hi> in the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> Catalogue, though at firſt their <hi>Calendar</hi> cou'd ſhew but Twenty Five <hi>Divinities.</hi> But when once they had found out a way to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſh theſe <hi>Divinities</hi> into ſeveral Claſſes or Ranks, terming ſome <hi>Gods</hi> of the Greater Nations, others of the Leſſer; having alſo their Tutelar <hi>Genii,</hi> their <hi>Demigods,</hi> their <hi>Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral</hi> and <hi>Houſhold Gods,</hi> &amp;c. there was no limit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the crafty Devices of the <hi>Priests</hi> and <hi>Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers</hi> in impoſing; or the Superſtition of the credulous People in believing and adoring an infinite Rabble of New, Young, and Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heard-of <hi>Divinities.</hi>
                  </p>

                  <p>THE Subject of moſt Mens Diſcourſe at preſent in this City, is the Taking of <hi>Friburgh</hi> by the <hi>French.</hi> This is a City of <hi>Germany,</hi> whereof I made frequent mention in my Letters when I firſt came to <hi>Paris.</hi> It is ſituated on a certain Height near a ſmall River, and is encompaſs'd with two Walls. Strengthned alſo by a Citadel, four Baſtions, and other Fortifications. The Emperor has likewiſe a ſtrong Garriſon in it.</p>
                  <p>On the 10th of this <hi>Moon</hi> the <hi>Mareſchal de Crequy</hi> Beſieg'd it, and preſs'd it with ſuch vigorous Aſſaults, and continual Batteries, That the Governour found himſelf oblig'd to Surrender it on the 17th, when the <hi>Mareſchal</hi> took Poſſeſſion of it in the Name of the <hi>French</hi> King.</p>

But the Want of Proviſions, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with the ſtout Reſiſtance of the Inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants, and the Duke of <hi>Luxemburgh</hi>'s Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach with the <hi>French</hi> Army, forced him to decamp and retire.</p>

                  <p>I Obey thy Commands without the leaſt Demur: And now proceed to write of the <hi>Macedonian Empire.</hi> I remember a <hi>Diſpatch</hi> of mine to thy Venerable <hi>Predeceſſor</hi> of Sacred Memory, wherein I touch'd upon

                     <hi>Alexander,</hi> as the <hi>Greeks</hi> and <hi>Latins</hi> call him, with all the <hi>Nations</hi> of the <hi>West;</hi> or <hi>Scander, Aſcander,</hi> and <hi>Zulkarnek,</hi> according to the Style of the <hi>Arabians, Perſians, Indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, Tartars,</hi> and other People of the <hi>East,</hi> was born in the CVIth <hi>Olympiad;</hi> 398 Years after the Building of <hi>Rome,</hi> and in the Year of the <hi>World</hi> 3628, on the 6th Day of the <hi>Moon Loo,</hi> or <hi>Hecatombaeon,</hi> according to the Style of the <hi>Grecians.</hi> The ſame Night was the <hi>Temple</hi> of <hi>Diana</hi> at <hi>Epheſus</hi> ſet on Fire. And on the ſame Day two <hi>Eagles</hi> came and pearch'd on the Top of his Fathers Houſe, where they ſat all the Day; which was ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken as an <hi>Omen</hi> of the <hi>Double Empire</hi> he was to have over <hi>Europe</hi> and <hi>Aſia.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Philip</hi> King of <hi>Macedon</hi> and Husband to <hi>Olympias,</hi> was the Reputed Father of <hi>Alexan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,</hi> as ſhe was his Known Mother. But ſome <hi>Hiſtorians</hi> ſay, That a certain <hi>Magician</hi> call'd <hi>Nectanebus,</hi> by his Enchantments diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſing himſelf in the Form of <hi>Jupiter Ammon,</hi> lay with <hi>Olympias,</hi> and begot <hi>Alexander.</hi> Others affirm, That <hi>Olympias</hi> her ſelf confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to <hi>Philip,</hi> That <hi>Alexander</hi> was not his Son, but that ſhe had conceiv'd him of a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digious great <hi>Serpent.</hi> Whence it came to paſs, That <hi>Philip</hi> himſelf, a little before his Death, openly declar'd, That <hi>Alexander</hi> was
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:102965:77"/>not his Son. And for the ſame Reaſon, he divorc'd <hi>Olympias,</hi> as an <hi>Adultreſs,</hi> by her own Confeſſion.</p>
                  <p>Theſe Reports were ſo common at that Time, That <hi>Alexander</hi> afterwards hearing the Story of his ſuppos'd <hi>Serpentine Genealogy,</hi> and that other of <hi>Nectanebus</hi> in the Maſque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rade of a <hi>God:</hi> When he march'd through <hi>Egypt,</hi> took Advantage of the latter, to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe upon the Credulity and Superſtition of his Soldiers. For being to paſs by the <hi>Temple</hi> of <hi>Jupiter Ammon,</hi> he made a Halt to viſit the <hi>Oracle.</hi> But he had privately ſent before ſome of his Truſty Friends to acquaint the <hi>Prieſts</hi> with his Deſign, and to tell them what manner of Words and Addreſs they ſhould uſe to him as he enter'd the <hi>Temple,</hi> in the Hearing of his <hi>Followers.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Having thus prepar'd thoſe <hi>Holy Cheats,</hi> he with much Ceremony and ſeeming Devotion made his Approaches to the <hi>Temple.</hi> As ſoon as he ſet his Foot within the <hi>Portico,</hi> the <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niors</hi> of the <hi>Prieſts</hi> met him in their <hi>Pontifical Robes,</hi> with <hi>Cenſers</hi> in their Hands, and thus ſaluted him; <hi>All Hail, Son of Jupiter Ammon. Alexander</hi> being pleas'd at this, ask'd them farther, <hi>If all his Fathers Murderers were pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh'd;</hi> or, <hi>If any yet ſurvived?</hi> To which it was anſwer'd, <hi>O Son of the Immortal Gods! Thy Father cannot be murder'd or dye. As for King</hi> Philip, <hi>his Blood is fully reveng'd on them that had a Hand in ſhedding it.</hi> Then he add<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed another Queſtion concerning his future Succeſs. To which the <hi>Oracle</hi> replied, <hi>The
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:102965:78"/>Victory ſhall be thine in all Battels; Thou ſhalt become Lord of all the Eaſt.</hi> The ſame Mouth alſo gave in Charge to the Retinue of <hi>Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ander, That they ſhould adore him not as a King, but as a God.</hi> Returning from thence, he built <hi>Alexandria,</hi> calling it after his own Name.</p>
                  <p>I have not obſerv'd a due Method in rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting this Story ſo ſoon; whilſt I was but re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſenting the New-born <hi>Hero</hi> in his Cradle. But I did it to convince thee, That the vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Opinions concerning <hi>Alexander</hi>'s Father, are not the Fictions of Wanton <hi>Writers,</hi> but ſuch as Employ'd the Care and Diligence of <hi>Alexander</hi> himſelf to improve them to his own Intereſt, and his Mothers Honour: For it was accounted a Glorious Thing, to be Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pregnate by a God.</p>
                  <p>To return therefore to the <hi>Infant-Prophet;</hi> He grew apace, and diſcover'd early Signs of a prodigious Wit and Courage. At the Age of fifteen Years, he was committed to the Care and Tutelage of <hi>Ariſtotle,</hi> under whom he ſtudied the <hi>Sciences</hi> five Years; and then his Father <hi>Philip</hi> being murder'd, he ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded in the <hi>Throne.</hi> The ſame Year alſo, <hi>Darius Codomanus</hi> obtained the <hi>Empire</hi> of <hi>Perſia.</hi> Againſt whom <hi>Alexander,</hi> with the Common Conſent of almoſt all <hi>Greece,</hi> prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to go with a well-diſciplin'd Army, that he might carry on the <hi>War</hi> which his Father had begun. Only the <hi>Lacedaemonians, The<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bans,</hi> and <hi>Athenians</hi> thwarted his Deſign; being corrupted by <hi>Demoſthenes</hi> the <hi>Orator,</hi>
                     <pb n="131" facs="tcp:102965:78"/>who for that purpoſe had received vaſt Sums of Gold from <hi>Darius.</hi> But <hi>Alexander</hi> ſoon reduc'd theſe Factious <hi>States</hi> and <hi>Kingdoms</hi> to their Duty; utterly deſtroying the City of <hi>Thebes,</hi> with the Slaughter of 90000 of the Citizens, beſides 30000 Captives. This was executed on the 15th of the <hi>Moon Boedromion,</hi> in the 2d Year of the CXIth <hi>Olympiad.</hi> He only ſpar'd the <hi>Host</hi> of <hi>Philip</hi> his Father, when he was left as a Pledge in that City, whoſe Houſe was left untouch'd, as alſo that of <hi>Pindar</hi>'s Poſterity.</p>
                  <p>From thence paſſing the <hi>Helleſpont,</hi> he march'd into <hi>Aſia,</hi> in the Year of the <hi>World</hi> 3650; and in the 3d Year of his <hi>Reign.</hi> He had in his Army 30000 Foot and 4500 Horſe. As ſoon as he ſet Foot on the Ground of <hi>Aſia,</hi> he made the Royal <hi>Corban</hi> and <hi>Vows</hi> for <hi>Victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry.</hi> Then he darted a Javelin into the Earth, in Token of Defiance. After which, when he came to <hi>Troy,</hi> he perform'd certain Holy <hi>Rites</hi> and <hi>Myſteries</hi> at the <hi>Tombs</hi> of Defunct <hi>Heroes,</hi> who fell in the <hi>Trojan War.</hi> When theſe <hi>Ceremonies</hi> were accompliſh'd, he march<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed directly againſt the <hi>Perſians,</hi> who were in Number 600000 Fighting Men. I will not tire thee with all the Particularities that hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen'd in their <hi>March.</hi> Suffice it to ſay, That <hi>Alexander</hi> with his Handful of <hi>Mace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>donians,</hi> after many Victories obtained of the <hi>Perſians,</hi> at length quite Routed the Army of <hi>Darius,</hi> and took Poſſeſſion of that Once Formidable <hi>Empire.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <pb n="132" facs="tcp:102965:79"/>
                  <p>But there are ſome remarkable Paſſages in this Expedition, which deſerve to be remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred: As, his wonderful Continence and Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manity toward the Mother, Wife and Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of <hi>Darius;</hi> whom he entertain'd in his Camp after they fell into his Hands, rather as the Kindred of ſome Beloved Friend, than of a Profeſs'd Enemy. The Story alſo of his looſing the <hi>Gordian Knot,</hi> is not unworthy thy Knowledge.</p>
                  <p>It ſeems, in former Times one <hi>Gordius,</hi> as he Plough'd the Fields, was ſurrounded with a Flight of Birds of all Kinds. Being trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled at this, he left his Work, and haſted to the next City, there to enquire of the <hi>Augurs,</hi> what the Meaning of this ſhould be. As he entred the Gate of the City, he met a Virgin of Incomparable Beauty, of whom he ask'd, <hi>Where he might find the most Skilful Sage, with whom he might conſult about a Matter of ſome Importance.</hi> Then he told the Inquiſitive Damſel, what had happen'd to him in the Field. As ſoon as ſhe heard this, being well vers'd in theſe <hi>Myſterious</hi> and <hi>Prophetick Sci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences,</hi> ſhe told him, <hi>That he ſhould be made a King.</hi> And to confirm him in the Belief of what ſhe ſaid, ſhe promis'd to become his Wife, that ſo ſhe might be Partner of his Fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture Happineſs. In a Word, they were Married; and ſoon after, there aroſe a Strife among the <hi>Phrygians,</hi> which was like to prove of dangerous Conſequence. Therefore the People Conſulted the <hi>Oracle, What was to be done in this Caſe, to prevent the publick Deſola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion?</hi>
                     <pb n="133" facs="tcp:102965:79"/>It was anſwer'd, <hi>That the only Remedy for theſe Diſcords was, to chuſe them a King.</hi> And when they ask'd, <hi>What Perſon they ſhould chuſe to this Dignity?</hi> It was anſwer'd again, <hi>That they ſhould Elect that Man for their King, whom they first met with a Wagon, as they wont thence to the Temple of Jupiter. Gor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dius</hi> prov'd the Man, and they obey'd the <hi>Oracle,</hi> ſaluting him as their <hi>Sovereign. Gor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dius,</hi> as a Memorial of this Event, ſet up his <hi>Wain</hi> in the <hi>Temple</hi> of <hi>Jupiter,</hi> conſecrating it to the <hi>Royal</hi> Majeſty.</p>
                  <p>After him his Son <hi>Midas</hi> Reign'd, who fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>Phrygia</hi> with <hi>Religious</hi> Obſervations. Whence aroſe the Common <hi>Oracle, That who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever ſhould looſe the Knot of the Thongs in the Wagon of</hi> Gordius, <hi>ſhould obtain the Empire of all</hi> Aſia.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Alexander</hi> hearing this, and being ſpurr'd on by Ambition, Beſieges <hi>Gordia;</hi> and having taken the City, makes haſte to the <hi>Temple</hi> of <hi>Jupiter,</hi> where he underſtood the <hi>Wagon</hi> was laid up. As ſoon as he ſaw it, he try'd to find out the Ends of the Thongs, that ſo he might looſe the Knot. But perceiving that it was impoſſible to come at them without uſing Violence, he interpreted the <hi>Oracle</hi> in the Senſe of a Soldier, and cut the outermoſt Foldings of the Knot with his Sword. Upon which all the Ends of the Thongs appear'd, and ſo he eaſily perform'd the Fatal Task.</p>
                  <p>Yet this <hi>Heroick Prophet,</hi> as he had Great <hi>Virtues,</hi> ſo had he no Leſs <hi>Vices.</hi> He was very cruel to his Neareſt Relations and
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:102965:80"/>Friends; Killing <hi>Caranus</hi> his Brother by a Step-Mother; <hi>Clitus</hi> his old dear Friend; <hi>Parmenio, Philotas, Aryntas, Attalus, Eurylo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chus, Pauſanias,</hi> and many other <hi>Macedonian Princes,</hi> ſome of which were of his own <hi>Blood.</hi> Add to this, his barbarous Uſage of <hi>Caliſthenes</hi> the <hi>Philoſopher,</hi> who was brought up with him under <hi>Ariſtotle.</hi> This poor Unfortunate Man refuſing to flatter the <hi>King</hi>'s Pride in calling him a <hi>God;</hi> ſo diſguſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <hi>Alexander,</hi> that feigning himſelf very An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gry, he charg'd him with being Acceſſary to the <hi>Plots</hi> and <hi>Conſpiracies</hi> that were formed againſt him. Then he caus'd all his Limbs to be mangl'd and chop'd, after an inhuman Faſhion. He commanded alſo his Ears, Noſe, and Lips, to be cut off; which not only gave the Poor Wretch infinite Torment, but alſo render'd him a moſt Deform'd and Miſera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Spectacle to others. And to compleat his Revenge, he caus'd him in this Doleful Plight to be ſhut up in a Cage with a Dog, and ſo to be carried about, to the Terror of others.</p>
                  <p>Then <hi>Lyſimachus,</hi> one of <hi>Alexander's Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rals,</hi> and a <hi>Diſciple</hi> of <hi>Caliſthenes,</hi> taking Pity on ſo Great a <hi>Sage,</hi> who ſuffer'd all this bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barous Uſage, not for any real Crime that he had committed, but only for uſing that Free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom in his Words and Actions which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes a <hi>Philoſopher,</hi> gave him Poyſon, to rid him at once of ſo many horrid Calamities.</p>
                  <p>But <hi>Alexander</hi> took this ſo heinouſly, That he commanded <hi>Lyſimachus</hi> to be thrown to a
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:102965:80"/>very fierce Lion. As ſoon as the Furious Beaſt ſaw him, he Roar'd and Paw'd the Ground for Joy, and ran upon him with an impetuous Force. But <hi>Lyſimachus</hi> not loſing his Courage, wrap'd his Hand in his Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle, and thruſt it down the Lion's Throat; where laying faſt hold of his Tongue, he pull'd it out by the Roots, and left the Lion for dead.</p>
                  <p>When this was told the <hi>King,</hi> he admiring the Invincible Virtue of the Man, not only forgav<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>We muſt not omit that Memorable Action of <hi>Alexander,</hi> when ſtomaching the Surrender of <hi>Sidon</hi> to his Victorious Arms, in that it was deliver'd up by the People, againſt the Will of <hi>Strato</hi> their <hi>King;</hi> the <hi>Conqueror</hi> pronoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing <hi>Strato</hi> unworthy of the <hi>Crown,</hi> bid <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheſtion</hi> place him in the <hi>Throne,</hi> whom the <hi>Sidonians</hi> ſhould approve as <hi>Strato</hi>'s <hi>Succeſſor.

<pb n="136" facs="tcp:102965:81"/>any Man of the <hi>Royal Blood</hi> whom you think fit for ſo great a Charge.</q> Then he pitch'd upon one <hi>Abdolonymus,</hi> a poor <hi>Gardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner</hi> in the <hi>Suburbs of Sidon;</hi> who was of the Race of <hi>Sidonian</hi> Kings, but through ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treme Poverty was grown obſcure, and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced to take up that Employment to get his Bread. <hi>Hepheſtion</hi> approv'd the Choice: And this Noble Youth, with ſome of his Friends, immediately went with the <hi>Royal Robes</hi> and <hi>Enſigns</hi> of <hi>Majeſty</hi> to look out <hi>Abdolonymus,</hi> whom they ſound Weeding his Garden in a very dirty ſqualid Condition. Saluting him therefore <hi>King</hi> in the Name of <hi>Alexander</hi> the <hi>Great,</hi> they Waſh'd and Anointed him with Precious Oyls of the <hi>East;</hi> and having put on the <hi>Robes</hi> of <hi>Soveraign Majeſty,</hi> they Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducted him to the <hi>Conqueror:</hi> Who among other Diſcourſes, ask'd him, <hi>How he was able ſo patiently to endure that extreme Poverty which had hitherto been his Lot?</hi> To which he replied, <hi>I wiſh I may endure the Burden of a Crown with the ſame Eaſe. Theſe Hands ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved the Neceſſities of Life, and my Wants were anſwerable to my Poſſeſſions, even none at all. Alexander</hi> perceiving by this Anſwer, the Greatneſs of his Spirit, gave him all the <hi>Roy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al</hi> Furniture of <hi>Strato,</hi> with much of the <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſian</hi> Booty, and added all the Countries round about <hi>Sidon</hi> to his Government.</p>
                  <p>Much about the ſame Time, <hi>Alexander</hi> going to <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> was met by <hi>Jaddus</hi> the <hi>High Priest</hi> in his <hi>Pontifical Habit.</hi> Who falling at the <hi>Conqueror</hi>'s Feet, to implore
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:102965:81"/>Favour and Mercy for his City and People; <hi>Alexander</hi> rais'd him up, and embracing him in his Arms, <hi>Bid him fear nothing, for that God had appeared to him in</hi> Macedonia, <hi>in the ſame Figure and Form as the High-Priest made, exhorting him, to carry on the</hi> Perſian <hi>War, and promiſing him certain Victory.</hi> After this, the <hi>High-Priest</hi> conducted him into the <hi>City</hi> and <hi>Temple,</hi> where he Sacrific'd and made <hi>Corban.</hi> He alſo gave the <hi>Jews</hi> many ample Privileges.</p>
                  <p>There is one Thing more in the <hi>Life</hi> of <hi>Alexander,</hi> which becauſe it has ſomething very ſingular in it, I will inſert in this <hi>Diſpatch.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>After the <hi>Conquest</hi> of <hi>Perſia,</hi> as <hi>Alexander</hi> was marching forward, that he might extend his <hi>Empire</hi> through all the <hi>East; Thaleſtris, Queen</hi> of the <hi>Amazons,</hi> hearing of his Fame, took a Journey of five and twenty Days, through many populous Nations, attended only by three hundred Women, and came to his Camp, courting the Honour of his Bed. For ſhe had conceived an inſatiable Deſire of having a Child by <hi>Him,</hi> whom all the <hi>East</hi> proclaimed the Greateſt <hi>Hero</hi> in the World. <hi>Alexander</hi> granted her Requeſt; and when ſhe had enjoy'd his Company thirteen Days, ſhe departed well ſatisfied to her own Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, promiſing, that if ſhe brought forth a <hi>Male,</hi> ſhe would ſend him to his Father, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the manner of the <hi>Amazons;</hi> but if a <hi>Female,</hi> ſhe wou'd keep it her ſelf.</p>
                  <pb n="138" facs="tcp:102965:82"/>
                  <p>From hence <hi>Alexander</hi> march'd againſt <hi>Beſſus,</hi> who had murder'd <hi>Darius,</hi> and cauſed himſelf to be proclaimed King of <hi>Perſia</hi> by the Name of <hi>Artaxerxes.</hi> Having overcome him, and puniſh'd his Treaſons, he proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and ſubdu'd all the <hi>Regions</hi> running along the Foot of Mount <hi>Cancaſus.</hi> In fine, he ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended his Conqueſts to the utmoſt Borders of <hi>India,</hi> even to the <hi>Oriental</hi> Sea; where he took Shipping and return'd to <hi>Babylon,</hi> partly by Sea and partly by Land. An <hi>Aſtrologer</hi> of great Reputation met him by the way, and diſſuaded him by all the Arguments he could uſe, from entring the City; aſſuring him, that Place would be Fatal to his Perſon. But though <hi>Alexander</hi> made ſome Demur at firſt, and ſeem'd to credit the Words of the <hi>Sage;</hi> yet being over-rul'd by the Counſel of <hi>Anaxarchus</hi> the <hi>Philoſopher,</hi> he enter'd <hi>Baby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lon,</hi> where he died; ſome ſay of Poyſon; others affirm, that he ſurfeited himſelf with too much Wine. This was in the 33d Year of his <hi>Life,</hi> and the 12th of his <hi>Reign.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>There was a deep and melancholy Silence throughout <hi>Babylon,</hi> whon once it was known, <hi>That the</hi> Conqueror <hi>of the World was dead.</hi> Every one was poſſeſs'd with various Thoughts and Cares, according to their dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent Affections and Intereſts. The <hi>Mace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>donians</hi> inwardly rejoyc'd, as if they were now rid of ſome great and formidable Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my; curſing his Severity and reſtleſs Temper, which had expos'd them to ſo many Toils and Perils of War. Beſides, the <hi>Princes</hi> flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter'd
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:102965:82"/>themſelves with a proſpect of enjoying every one his Share in ſo vaſt an <hi>Empire.</hi> And the private Soldiers had their Eyes in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tently fix'd hn the Immenſe Treaſures of Gold, which <hi>Alexander</hi> left behind him, and which they hop'd to ſhare among them. For there were at that time Fifty Thouſand Talents in Bank; and Three Hundred Thouſand coming in yearly by way of Tribute and Cuſtom.</p>
                  <p>On the other ſide, the Conquer'd <hi>Nations</hi> would not at firſt give Credit to the Report of thoſe, who carry'd the News of <hi>Alexan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der</hi>'s Fate. For they thought he muſt needs be <hi>Immortal,</hi> whom they had always found <hi>Invincible.</hi> But when <hi>Couriers</hi> upon <hi>Couriers</hi> had remov'd their Incredulity, bringing Freſh <hi>Expreſſes</hi> from <hi>Babylon;</hi> they Mourn'd for him, not with bare Outward Ceremonies, as for an <hi>Enemy</hi> that had ſubdu'd 'em; but with Real Sorrow, as for a <hi>Father</hi> that had pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tected and cheriſh'd 'em.</p>
                  <p>More eſpecially, the Grief of <hi>Darius</hi>'s Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther was remarkable; who, tho ſhe had loſt Eighty of her Brethren, with their Father, all cruelty Murder'd by <hi>Ochus,</hi> tho ſhe had loſt <hi>Darius,</hi> the only ſurviving of ſeven Sons; and was her ſelf caſt down from the Height of <hi>Majeſty,</hi> to the Abject State of a <hi>Captive;</hi> yet ſhe bore all with an Even Mind, till <hi>Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ander's</hi> Death; whoſe Indulgence alone whilſt living, had ſupported her under ſo many grievous Calamities. But as ſoon as he had forſaken the Earth, ſhe grew weary of tarry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing any longer on it too. Not that ſhe eſteem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:102965:83"/>an Enemy above her Father, Brethren and her Son; but becauſe ſhe had experienc'd in him whom ſhe dreaded as an Enemy, the Goodneſs and Piety, the Modeſty and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatd of all theſe <hi>Relations.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This Great <hi>Monarch</hi> being Dead, and not having appointed a <hi>Succeſſor,</hi> there aroſe al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt as many <hi>Kings,</hi> as there were <hi>Governours</hi> of <hi>Provinces,</hi> and <hi>Leaders</hi> in the <hi>Army.</hi> Hence ſprang Innumerable Confuſions, Wars and Diſorders in the <hi>Empire.</hi> There were Tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mults and Inſurrections in <hi>Greece,</hi> eſpecially at <hi>Athens;</hi> where the Citizens under the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct of <hi>Leoſthenes</hi> their <hi>Captain,</hi> invited the Reſt of the <hi>Grecians</hi> to aſſert their Liberty by taking Arms. Nor was there leſs ſtirs in <hi>Aſia</hi> and <hi>Egypt.</hi> Every where Mens Minds were unſetled, and deſirous of Novelty. <hi>Ptolomy</hi> had <hi>Egypt</hi> for his Share of the Cantoniz'd <hi>Empire.</hi> There he eſtabliſh'd himſelf and his Poſterity by the Name of <hi>Kings. Seleucus</hi> took poſſeſſion of <hi>Babylon</hi> and <hi>Syria,</hi> with the ſame Title. <hi>Caſſander</hi> Reign'd over <hi>Macedon</hi> and <hi>Greece. Antigonus</hi> govern'd <hi>Aſia,</hi> and <hi>Lyſimachus Thrace.</hi> But as <hi>Antigonus</hi> ſoon loſt his <hi>Empire,</hi> being overcome and kill'd in a Battel by <hi>Ptolomy</hi> and his <hi>Confederates:</hi> So did the reſt either in their own Perſons, or in their Poſterity, yield to the prevailing For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune of their Enemies; Till at length all theſe ſhatter'd Remains of the <hi>Macedonian Empire,</hi> became <hi>Provinces</hi> of the <hi>Roman.</hi> Of which I will ſay ſomething in my next.</p>
                  <pb n="141" facs="tcp:102965:83"/>
                  <p>In the mean while, I triumph to think that the <hi>Ottoman Empire</hi> now, is become more Formidable, Large and Victorious, than all that went before it. May <hi>God</hi> encreaſe the Felicities and Honours of <hi>True Belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers,</hi> till the Day of the Final <hi>Metamor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phoſis.</hi>

                  <head>LETTER II.</head>
                  <head>
                     <hi>To</hi> Muſu Abul Yahyan, Profeſſor <hi>of</hi> Philoſophy <hi>at</hi> Fez.</head>
                  <p>I Received thy Venerable <hi>Diſpatch</hi> with great Satisfaction, and am glad to find thou art ſo far from being tir'd with what I have already ſaid concerning <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> that thou challengeſt me with a Promiſe I formerly made thee, of giving thee a farther Account of what I have obſerved there moſt remarkable.</p>
                  <p>In deſcribing this Imperial City, I have imitated the Painters, who when they wou'd draw a Beauty to the Life, do not go <hi>Arith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>metically</hi> to work, or obſerve any Order in their rough Draughts. But following the Conduct of a wild and ſtrong Fancy, they daſh their Pencil here and there, as that Vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latile Faculty inſpires 'em; regarding only the Symmetry of the Picture, without preferring one Part to another, or being curious in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineating every little Singularity. So I in pourtraying this Queen of Cities, this ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lative Beauty of the whole Earth, draw my Strokes at Random; not deſigning to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent thee with an <hi>Anatomy-Lecture</hi> over her, or to unveil all her interior Secrets: But only to give thee a tranſient View of thoſe Parts which appear moſt Eminent, and attract the
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:102965:84"/>Eyes of all Travellers. And this I do not perform all at once ('twere too great a Task) but even like them, by Fits and Starts, as I find my Opportunities.</p>
                  <p>I have hitherto preſented thee with a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of very magnificent and curious Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects; as Temples, Moſques, Aqueducts, Columns, Obelisks, Bazars, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Now pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare thine Eyes for an Entertainment of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Nature. I will ſhew thee Things, though perhaps not ſo illuſtrious to outward Appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, or ſtrutting with Royal Grandure, yet ſufficiently Great and Splendid to perpetuate the Memory of the Founders, and to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vey their Fame to all Generations. Things alſo of publick Uſe and Service; Deſigns of Charity, Policy, and generous Wiſdom; Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertakings of a Noble and Heroick Chara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cter, as thou wilt perceive by the following Account.</p>
                  <p>No Traveller can ſurvey the Streets of <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> and not have his Eyes arreſted here and there by moſt capacious and ample Carvanſera's where all diſtreſſed Foreigners, and ſuch as are deſtitute of a more conveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent Lodging, may in any of theſe find a Shel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter and Sanctuary from the Injuries of open Air, from Night-Robbers, and other Incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veniencies. Theſe Carvanſera's are in num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber Three Hundred and Three, built at the Expences of <hi>Ottoman</hi> Princes and Baſſa's.</p>
                  <p>There are alſo in this City Ninety Hoſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tals, where the Poor are nouriſhed, and the Sick attended with extraordinary Piety and Care.</p>
                  <pb n="144" facs="tcp:102965:85"/>
                  <p>Beſides all theſe, there are Five Colleges, where the Sciences are publickly profeſs'd and taught, and where a certain Number of Young Men are educated and maintained at the <hi>Grand Signior</hi>'s Coſt, being conſtant Sti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendaries to the <hi>Sultan.</hi> There are many ſuch Colleges ſcatter'd up and down <hi>Caramania, Natolia,</hi> and throughout <hi>Greece</hi> and the <hi>Leſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſer Aſia.</hi> So that the Number of Students in theſe Countries is computed to be above Nine Thouſand; not reckoning thoſe in <hi>Arabia, Syria,</hi> and <hi>Egypt,</hi> where flouriſh innumerable Seminaries of Divine and Human Wiſdom.</p>
                  <p>But to return to <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> the next Thing worthy of Obſervation is the <hi>Serayan,</hi> or Houſe of Equipages, where are made all ſorts of Trappings for Horſes, eſpecially Sad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dles of immenſe Coſt, and admirable Work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manſhip. This Place is alſo environ'd with high Walls, and ſhut in with ſtrong Gates. There cannot be a more agreeable Sight to ſuch as take Pleaſure in Horſes and Riding, than to ſee Four Thouſand Men here daily at Work in their Shops, each ſtriving to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cel the reſt in the Curioſity of his Artifice. You ſhall ſee one buſie in ſpangling a Sad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle with great Oriental Pearls, and Unions intermix'd, for ſome <hi>Arabian</hi> Horſe, belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, perhaps, to the <hi>Vizir Azem.</hi> Another fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting a Curb or Bit of the pureſt Gold to a Bridle of moſt precious <hi>Ruſſian</hi> Leather; ſome adorn their Trappings with choice <hi>Phrygian</hi> Work, others with Diamonds, Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bies, and the moſt coſtly Jewels of the Eaſt.
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:102965:85"/>In a Word, there is ſo illuſtrious a Variety of theſe Accoutrements, that the Eye is aſtoniſh'd at the ſight of them: And I have heard many Travellers acknowledge, That the like is not to be ſeen in any City of the World beſide <hi>Conſtantinople.</hi> I know not what may be in your Cities of <hi>Morocco</hi> and <hi>Fez,</hi> in regard the <hi>Moors</hi> are great Cavaliers.</p>
                  <p>There are, moreover, two other Places in the City, encompaſs'd with peculiar Walls. In theſe the <hi>Jainzaries</hi> are poſted, who are the <hi>Guards du Corps</hi> to the <hi>Grand Signior.</hi> They are under the Command of <hi>Decurions,</hi> without whoſe Leave no <hi>Janizary</hi> dare ſet a Foot out of the Place.</p>
                  <p>Next is the <hi>Arſenal</hi> of the City, built on the Sea-ſhore, containing a Hundred and Eighty Arches, under which are very elegant <hi>Portico's</hi> or <hi>Piazza's,</hi> where People walk. There are above Forty Thouſand Men daily at Work in this <hi>Arſenal;</hi> and Eighty great Gallies lie there always in Readineſs for any ſudden Expedition.</p>
                  <p>Beſides, there is another in the Suburbs, wherein there always lie a Hundred and Fif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty great Gallies on the Stocks; and Sixty, fitted up with all Neceſſaries, conſtantly lie in the Water.</p>
                  <p>The Granaries or Store-Houſes for Corn preſent themſelves next. They are built in a Corner of the City toward <hi>Pera,</hi> where the Walls are far ſtronger than in any other Part, and the Gates are of Iron. Here is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways laid up an immenſe Quantity of Wheat
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:102965:86"/>and Barly, as alſo of other Grain, as if it were to ſerve for many Years. Yet 'tis changed for new Corn every Three Years. They ſay, That in the Reign of <hi>Amurat</hi> III. there was an incredible Abundance of <hi>Millet</hi> found there, whoſe Vertue was much admired, in that it had lain there Eighty Years ſound and free from any Corruption.</p>
                  <p>I have purpoſely omitted to ſpeak of the two <hi>Royal Serails,</hi> ſince the leaſt of them will require a large Letter by it ſelf, to be deſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed exactly. Only this I will ſay in ſhort, That the leaſt is a <hi>French League</hi> in Circuit, or Three <hi>Italian</hi> Miles; and the biggeſt, wherein the <hi>Grand Signior</hi> dwells is a League and two Thirds or Five <hi>Italian</hi> Miles. The former is called <hi>Eſchy Saray,</hi> or the <hi>Old Palace;</hi> the latter is nam'd <hi>Bryuch Saray,</hi> or the <hi>Great Serail.</hi> If thou deſireſt a farther and more particular Deſcription of theſe Royal Courts, I will ſend it thee in future <hi>Diſpatches.</hi> For, it will be too large for one.</p>
                  <p>In the mean Time I muſt not forget the <hi>Moſch</hi> of <hi>Jub,</hi> where our <hi>Sultans</hi> receive the Sword when they firſt come to the Crown. This is a Building of great Antiquity, ſeated in the fartheſt Angle of the City near the Haven. Over againſt it are the <hi>Sultan</hi>'s Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles, having very fair Gardens adjoin'd to them. Not far from thence is the <hi>Topana,</hi> or <hi>Gun-Yard,</hi> where there lies a vaſt Number of Braſs Pieces of Ordnance without Carriages. Of which ſome are turn'd directly againſt the Haven.</p>
                  <pb n="147" facs="tcp:102965:86"/>
                  <p>As you paſs from this Place, it is impoſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to avoid the ſight of a Pillar, which ſhoots up from the Top of a Rock at ſome diſtance from the City. This Column is all of White Marble, and was erected by <hi>Cn. Pompey</hi> as a Monument of his Victory over <hi>Mithridates</hi> the King of <hi>Pontus.</hi> On this ſide of the City there is nothing hardly to be ſeen for eight Miles together, but Houſes built for Pleaſure and Delight, with moſt beautiful Groves and Gardens.</p>
                  <p>Over againſt the City ſtands <hi>Pera,</hi> an Arm of the Sea coming between them. This Suburb or Borough is inhabited chiefly by <hi>Graecians</hi> and <hi>Weſtern Franks.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Round about this Suburb are many pretty Country Houſes, Farms, and Granges, moſt deliciouſly ſeated in the midſt of high Tufts of Trees, with Green Fields, and Cryſtal Streams adjoining to them. Where the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſadors of Foreign Princes make their Abode ſometimes.</p>
                  <p>I will not carry thee from hence to <hi>Scutari,</hi> though a great and ſtately Village, within the Liberty alſo of the Imperial City. I will not detain thee with the Singularities of the <hi>Thracian Cherſoneſus,</hi> or drill thee along to <hi>Calipolis;</hi> though this were the firſt Town in <hi>Europe,</hi> which <hi>Amurat</hi> took in the Year 1363. My Deſign is altogether at <hi>Conſtantinople.</hi> Therefore having ſurvey'd <hi>Pera,</hi> which is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo call'd <hi>Galata,</hi> let us croſs the Water, and return again to the Mother-City; that we may know what manner of Government
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:102965:87"/>there is in it, and how the Laws are exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuted.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Chief Magiſtrate</hi> is called <hi>Stambol-Cadiſi,</hi> or <hi>Judge</hi> of <hi>Conſtantinople.</hi> Before him are pleaded all Cauſes, both Criminal and Civil. He has four Deputies under him, who ſeparately govern the four chief Precincts of the City. There is likewiſe an Officer, cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>Sabaſſi,</hi> whoſe Buſineſs is to take Cogni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zance of every ones Crime that is ſeiſed in the Streets or Houſes, and to refer it to the <hi>Supreme Vizir.</hi> He has alſo four Deputies under him, and all Men are bound to aſſiſt him in Caſe of Difficulty.</p>
                  <p>The Common Priſon of <hi>Conſtantinople</hi> is divided into two Parts, the Upper and the Lower. The Upper is only for Civil Offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and has an airy Green Court in the mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle of it, with a Fountain continually ſpout<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing up Water; which ſomething diminiſhes the Squalidneſs of the Place. The Lower is for Capital Crimes, and is a very ſink of Horror and Loathſomnes.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Flower</hi> of <hi>Philoſophers,</hi> I pray <hi>God</hi> who gave us our Senſes, always grant 'em agreeable Objects, and defend us from all noiſome Scents, eſpecially from the Peſtilential Fumes of <hi>Hell,</hi> which, they ſay, at certain Times tranſpire through the Chinks and Crannies of the Earth, infecting this upper World with deplorable Contagions. May the Odours of <hi>Paradiſe</hi> refreſh us for ever, O Senſible <hi>Muſu.</hi>

                  <p>In the Beginning of the 3d <hi>Moon</hi> the <hi>King</hi> cauſed <hi>Ghaunt</hi> to be Beſieged by the <hi>Mareſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chal d' Humiers.</hi> This City is the Capital of all <hi>Flanders,</hi> and is divided into ſeveral Quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters or Iſles; ſo is the Country round about it, by certain Rivers and Channels, which render it of extreme difficult Acceſs, and ſpoils all Communication. It is one of the greateſt Cities in <hi>Europe,</hi> and is defended by a Counterſcarp, a large Ditch, good Ram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parts, and many Baſtions. The Inhabitants boaſt that it was Founded by <hi>Julius Caeſar.</hi> They have been able to raiſe an Army of Fifty Thouſand Men among themſelves, whenever they have been inclin'd to Revolt from their Soveraign. Yet they could not hold out above Ten Days againſt the preſent Arms of <hi>France;</hi> but ſeeing the Vigor with which they were attack'd on all ſides, and deſpairing of any Succors, they Surrender'd on Articles.</p>
                  <p>Next to this, the City of <hi>Ypres</hi> was Sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>render'd to them on the 25th of the ſame
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:102965:88"/>
                     <hi>Moon,</hi> after a Siege of Eight Days. This is another conſiderable City in <hi>Flanders.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Nor have the <hi>French</hi> Arms been Unſucceſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful in <hi>Catalonia</hi> under the Command of the <hi>Duke de Navailles.</hi> This <hi>General</hi> having Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken <hi>Puicerda</hi> the Capital City of that Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince, and a Place of great Strength, being ſeated on the Top of the <hi>Pyrenean</hi> Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains, and defended by a Caſtle built on a Rock. The <hi>Prince</hi> of <hi>Conde</hi> won it in the Year 1654. But it was afterwards reſtor'd to the <hi>Spaniards</hi> again by the Treaty of the <hi>Pyrene's;</hi> who Fortified it a-new with all the Modern Forms. This City has under its Command above Eighty Villages, and draws Contributions from all the Province of <hi>Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daigne.</hi> It ſecures the Poſſeſſion of <hi>Rouſſillon,</hi> covers the Frontiers of <hi>Languedoc,</hi> and is eſteem'd ſecond only to <hi>Barcelona,</hi> of all the Cities in theſe Parts.</p>
                  <p>From <hi>Germany</hi> and the Provinces bordering on the <hi>Rhine, Fame</hi> tranſports hither ſucceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive Relations of Battels fought between the <hi>French</hi> and the <hi>Imperialists,</hi> wherein the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer always get the Victory. The <hi>Mareſchal de Crequy</hi> engag'd with him firſt near <hi>Grotzin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ghen,</hi> where the <hi>Prince</hi> of <hi>Baden</hi> and Forty Officers of Note were Wounded on the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies ſide: The <hi>Count</hi> of <hi>Liqueville,</hi> a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mander under the <hi>Duke</hi> of <hi>Lorrain,</hi> with ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny others, were Taken Priſoners: The <hi>French</hi> Took from them a great Number of Standards, Kill'd Abundance of their Men, and in fine, remain'd Maſters of the Field.</p>
                  <pb n="151" facs="tcp:102965:88"/>
                  <p>No leſs Advantage had they in the 7th <hi>Moon,</hi> on the Plains of <hi>Rheinsfeldt,</hi> near the River <hi>Rhine.</hi> Where they Killed above 800 <hi>Imperialists</hi> upon the Spot; and the Bridge of <hi>Rheinsfeldt</hi> was ſo cramm'd with Dead Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, that they ſerv'd as a Barrier to ſtop the <hi>French</hi> from purſuing their Victory to the Gates of the City.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Mareſchal de Crequy</hi> alſo defeated a Body of 6000 Horſe and Dragoons, Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded by the <hi>Duke</hi> of <hi>Lorrain,</hi> near to <hi>Offembourg,</hi> which was followed by the Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of <hi>Ortambourg Caſtle,</hi> and the Fort of <hi>Kell,</hi> which the <hi>Mareſchal</hi> raz'd to the Ground. He Took alſo the Fort of <hi>Zolhau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlen;</hi> and encountring the <hi>Duke</hi> of <hi>Lorrain</hi> near a Place called <hi>Lauterbourg,</hi> he ſet upon him, and Kill'd 400 of his Men as they were paſſing a Bridge of the <hi>Rhine,</hi> and Took 300 Priſoners.</p>
                  <p>If they go on at this Rate Year after Year, it will be difficult to ſet the Limits of their continually growing Empire. Only we need not fear that they will ever be able to juſtle the <hi>Faithful Oſmans</hi> out of the Patrimony ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed them by <hi>Deſtiny.</hi>

                  <p>THou may'ſt be aſſured 'tis no Comple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, when I tell thee I condole thy Loſs. He that is Dead was my <hi>Brother</hi> as well as thy <hi>Husband.</hi> And the Friendſhip which was between us united us more cloſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly than did our Blood.

                  <p>When <hi>Peſteli</hi> pleaſes to divert himſelf with <hi>Women,</hi> 'tis but to wiſh, and one more Fair than e'er <hi>Apelles</hi> drew, preſents her ſelf, chaſte as <hi>Diana,</hi> yet as kind as <hi>Venus.</hi> No coy Demurs protract the Enjoyment of his Wiſh, nor is there the leaſt Sign of Impudence to pall it. But in perfect Love they meet each other, and unite their Hearts: And ſo they paſs their Time, in conſtant unrepented Bliſs.</p>
                  <p>He traverſes the pleaſant Walks of <hi>Eden,</hi> and ſits him down upon the Banks of her <hi>Immortal Rivers: Rivers</hi> that ſtream with <hi>Wine,</hi> and <hi>Milk,</hi> and <hi>Honey.</hi> Under the Shade of happy Trees he lies upon the <hi>Flowry Green,</hi> in the Careſſes of ſome love<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Daughter of <hi>Paradiſe.</hi> Whilſt <hi>Aroma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick</hi> Winds inſpire him with Diviner Paſſions than <hi>Endymion</hi> felt in the Embraces of <hi>Diana.

Whatever elevated Fancy can conceive of <hi>Bliſs,</hi> is all by infinite Odds ſurpaſs'd in the Enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of the <hi>Happy Souls Above.</hi> There is no Number, Weight, or Meaſure, of their <hi>Eternal</hi> and Superlative Felicities. <hi>They paſs from Joy to Joy, and ſport in endleſs Circles of Beatitude.

O Gardens of Incomparable Beauty! where the Liberal Monarch of the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſe regales the wearied Souls of Mortals with Banquets of Ineſtimable Price, and <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>n<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>match'd Delicacy, after their toilſome Pil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grimage on Earth.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>If <hi>Peſteli</hi> could hear, I would congra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tulate his Happineſs, inſtead of Condo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling thy Misfortune, in loſing ſuch a <hi>Huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band.</hi> He has eſcap'd the Shipwracks of this Lower World; this Sea of Grief and Tragedies.

                  <p>But, tell me, <hi>Dalimalched,</hi> were not you ſomething in the Fault, that the <hi>Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerous Peſteli</hi> left us both ſo ſoon? Did you not fret and teize his High-born Soul with Words which might have well been
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:102965:90"/>ſpar'd to a Man of ſo quick Senſe? Doubtleſs he needed not your fuming Lectures, and more ſilent Diſcipline of Powts. If he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted Faults, (as, who does not?) he ſoon was Senſible without a <hi>Reprimand.</hi> There was no Occaſion to keep him half a <hi>Moon</hi> in <hi>Paroxyſms</hi> of Melancholy and Grief. This was too hard a <hi>Penance</hi> for his Spirit to bear. But, you <hi>Women</hi> have Ways by your Selves, unintelligible to our Sex. Your Windings and Turnings are intricate as thoſe of Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pents. <hi>Daedalus</hi> himſelf, were he now alive, though once the Glory of Labyrinth-Makers, yet wou'd be puzzl'd to trace your Sex, in all your ſecret, wild, unknown <hi>Meanders.</hi> Ye are all the very changeable Things of the <hi>Earth.

                     <hi>Dalimalched,</hi> I tell thee, <hi>A Woman never commands a Man, unleſs he be a Fool, but by her Obedience; that way ſhe wins his Heart, and makes a thorough Conquest of his Affections.</hi> She wheadles him out of his Soveraignty by cunning Complaiſance and proper Capitula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, or at leaſt, by this Method, ſhe ſaves her ſelf.

                  <p>I Hope thou wilt pardon me, moſt Illuſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous <hi>Miniſter,</hi> that I have thus long delay'd to give thee a farther Account of the <hi>States</hi> of <hi>Europe:</hi> But now I will proceed; and, according to thy Command, begin where I left off.</p>
                  <p>Having already diſcours'd of <hi>Germany,</hi> I will deſcend into the <hi>Netherlands:</hi> Which is as Natural, as for a Man that has Survey'd the <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>pper Town</hi> of <hi>Buda,</hi> or any other City ſeated like that, to fall into the <hi>Lower.</hi> For ſo the <hi>Netherlands</hi> ſeem to be a Kind of Out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lying <hi>Borough,</hi> near the <hi>Suburb,</hi> to the <hi>German Empire.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>They are call'd the <hi>Netherlands,</hi> by Reaſon of their Low Situation, near the Sea: Which makes the Country appear like a Mariſh, or
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:102965:91"/>Moor. They contain Seventeen <hi>Provinces;</hi> Ten whereof are under the Juriſdiction of the <hi>King</hi> of <hi>Spain:</hi> The other Seven make up a Diſtinct and Independent <hi>Republick,</hi> among themſelves.</p>
                  <p>The Circumference of the Seventeen <hi>Provinces,</hi> is a Thouſand <hi>Italian</hi> Miles: And within that Compaſs, there are Two Hundred Wall'd Towns and Cities; an Hundred and Fifty other Places, which enjoy the ſame Privileges and Power as the Former: And there are Six Thouſand Villages.</p>
                  <p>In the Time of <hi>Julius Caeſar,</hi> this Tract of Ground was call'd <hi>Belgick-Gaul</hi> by the <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans.</hi> It was Inhabited by a Warlike Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, impatient of Servitude, and Stout Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſertors of their Native Liberty; as the ſame <hi>Caeſar</hi> found by Experience, when he Warr'd among them. Nay, and ſince that Time, the <hi>Muſſulmans</hi> themſelves have felt their Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour. Witneſs the Famous Expedition of <hi>Godfrey</hi> of <hi>Bullen,</hi> to recover the <hi>Holy-Land,</hi> out of the Hands of the <hi>Saracens:</hi> And that other of <hi>Baldwin</hi> the <hi>Fleming.</hi> who made himſelf Maſter of <hi>Conſtantinople,</hi> and the <hi>Grae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cian Empire.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Ancient <hi>Romans</hi> us'd to ſay, <hi>That the</hi> Gauls <hi>fought for their Liberty; the</hi> Germans <hi>for Booty; and the</hi> Dutch <hi>for Glory and Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour.</hi> Hence it came to paſs, that the <hi>Roman Emperors</hi> in thoſe Days, had always a Select Guard about their Perſons, choſen out of theſe <hi>Provinces,</hi> Alſo the <hi>Hollanders</hi> and <hi>Friz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>landers</hi>
                     <pb n="158" facs="tcp:102965:92"/>were call'd the Friends and Aſſociates of the <hi>Romans.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But, tho' theſe <hi>Provinces</hi> formerly had each a diſtinct <hi>Sovereign,</hi> with a Peculiar <hi>Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi> and <hi>Laws;</hi> yet, afterwards, they were all reduc'd under the <hi>Dominion</hi> of the <hi>Dukes</hi> of <hi>Burgundy:</hi> From whom, they devolv'd to the <hi>Arch-Dukes</hi> of <hi>Auſtria;</hi> and laſt of all, to the <hi>Kings</hi> of <hi>Spain;</hi> who claim a Title to Ten of them at this Day: But the <hi>King</hi> of <hi>France</hi> has Poſſeſſion of a Great Part. As for the other Seven, they are quite Emancipated, and Free. It being an eſtabliſh'd <hi>Maxim</hi> with them, That <hi>the Longeſt Sword gives the Beſt Title to a Government.</hi> And, for ought I ſee, this Principle is practis'd throughout the World.</p>
                  <p>The Inhabitants of the <hi>Netherlands</hi> are ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally Tall, and Strong-body'd People; Comely, Civil, Open-hearted, Courteous, Prompt and Laborious: More addicted to Wine, than to Women: Equally forgetful of Benefits, and Injuries: Great Muſicians, Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pert Sea-men, Cunning Merchants, Accurate Painters, and very Ingenious in all Arts. They are not Jealous of their Women, as moſt other Nations are; but ſuffer them to Walk abroad openly, and Converſe with Men in the Streets. Neither will any of theſe Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>males refuſe an Invitation to a Bottle of Wine. As ſoon as you come into any Houſe, the Daughter of the Family meets you, with a Bottle of Wine, or other Strong Beverage, in her Hand, and drinks it off to you: And if
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:102965:92"/>you do not very readily anſwer, and pledge her, it paſſes for a Sign of Rudeneſs, and Ill Manners.</p>
                  <p>Theſe People are very Rich, by Reaſon of their Merchandize and Traffick with other Nations; for they Export the Product of their Soil, and their own Manufactures; Vending or Exchanging them, at a Prodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious Advantage, in the Remoteſt Regions of the Earth.</p>
                  <p>They have very ſtrong Forts and Caſtles up and down the Country; with Cities which are, in a Manner, Inexpugnable. As for the <hi>Religion</hi> of the <hi>Netherlanders;</hi> The Ten <hi>Provinces</hi> which are ſubject to the <hi>King</hi> of <hi>Spain,</hi> or <hi>France,</hi> are called <hi>Catholicks.</hi> The other Seven repreſent the Celebrated <hi>Tower</hi> of <hi>Babel,</hi> where the <hi>Languages</hi> were firſt Confounded, as <hi>Moſes</hi> relates: For, ſuch is the Hotch-potch and Gallimaufrey of <hi>Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gions</hi> tolerated in <hi>Amſterdam, Leyden,</hi> and other Cities of <hi>Holland;</hi> and, in General, throughout all the Seven <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nited States.</hi> Neither have they much more Regularity and Order in other Matters. Wonder not therefore if my Pen obſerves no Method in Treating of a Country, which is the very <hi>Emblem, Proverb,</hi> and <hi>Centre</hi> of <hi>Ataxy</hi> and <hi>Confuſion.</hi> However, I will now begin to make more Particular Diſtinctions, than in the Former Part of my Letter.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Zeland</hi> has a bad Air, eſpecially in the Summer time, when the Sun exhales Stink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and Infectious Vapours from the Lakes
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:102965:93"/>and Pools, of which there is a great Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber in that <hi>Province:</hi> Yet it has an Excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent Soil, abounding with Wheat, and other Corn; alſo with good Paſturage, for Sheep and Cattel. There is little more to be ſaid of this <hi>Province.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Holland</hi> has this Obſervable in it, That frequently the <hi>Earth</hi> trembles there, under the Burden of Coaches, Wagons, Horſes, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Which is an Argument, that the Ground is hollow underneath, and full of Caverns. To confirm this Opinion, they ſay, <hi>That a Cow once falling into a Gap or Chaſm in the Earth, was found dead three Days afterwards in the Sea, being known to the Owner to be the ſame.</hi> Hence a Part of <hi>Holland,</hi> in the Language of the Country, is called <hi>Waterland:</hi> Which, at firſt Hearing, ſounds like a Contradiction: But they mean by it, <hi>a Land ſituated in the Waters.</hi> For, ſo, indeed, the whole <hi>Province</hi> appears to be divided into ſmall <hi>Iſlands,</hi> by Innumerable Canals, Lakes and Pools, that every where expoſe themſelves to your Eye. This <hi>Province</hi> deſerves moſt properly, of all the Reſt, the Appellation of <hi>Netherland;</hi> it being ſunk ſo very low, that, in many Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, the Sea riſes higher than it: Which compels the <hi>Hollanders</hi> to fortifie their Shores with High and Strong Banks; which, with great Coſt, they continually keep repair'd.</p>
                  <p>They have but little Corn, or Fruit, of their own Growth; being ſupply'd with thoſe Things from <hi>Germany, Poland,</hi> and other Countries. But there is an Immenſe Quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:102965:93"/>of Graſs, to nouriſh Millions of Sheep, Oxen, and Horſes.

                  <p>As to the Manners of theſe People: The <hi>Zelanders</hi> are of a Ready Wit, Provident, and Subtile: Of Stature, generally very tall; as will appear by a Woman of this <hi>Province,</hi> whom <hi>William Count</hi> of <hi>Holland</hi> ſent to the Nuptials of <hi>Charles the Fair, King</hi> of <hi>France. She</hi> was of ſo vaſt an Heighth and Bulk, that the <hi>French</hi> look'd like <hi>Pigmies,</hi> or <hi>Dwarfs,</hi> in Compariſon of <hi>her.</hi> And ſuch was <hi>her</hi> Strength, that <hi>She</hi> could lift from the Ground a Beam, and carry it on <hi>her</hi> Shoulders, which Eight Labouring Men cou'd hardly ſtir.</p>
                  <p>'Tis obſerv'd of <hi>Geldres,</hi> That it was the Firſt of theſe <hi>Provinces,</hi> which ſubmitted to the Riſing Fortune of the <hi>Roman Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire:</hi> And again, The Firſt that ſhook off the Yoke, when that <hi>Empire</hi> was in its Wane.</p>

                  <p>The Publick Affairs of all theſe <hi>Provin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,</hi> are manag'd by thoſe whom they call the <hi>States-General</hi> of the <hi>

                     <hi>LETTER VI.</hi> To the ſame.</head>
                  <p>THou wilt ſay, I'm all upon the Extremes. In my laſt I dragg'd thee through the moſt Dirty, Naſty, Abject Valley of all the <hi>Earth.</hi> I mean <hi>Holland,</hi> with the reſt of the <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nited Provinces.</hi> Now I'm going to lead thee out of thoſe <hi>Fenny Bogs,</hi> and give thee a Breathing up the Salubrious Hills and Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains of <hi>Helvetia</hi> or <hi>Swiſſerland.</hi> 'Tis true, this cannot be done without a conſiderable Leap over many <hi>Provinces</hi> of <hi>Germany,</hi> Part of <hi>Lorrain</hi> and <hi>Alſace.</hi> But, having ſpoken formerly of the <hi>Empire,</hi> and from thence in my next, by a kind of Natural Deſcent, fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len into the <hi>Low Countries;</hi> the Conſideration of their Form of Government, put me in mind of the other <hi>Republicks</hi> in <hi>Europe.</hi> Among which, that of <hi>Switzerland</hi> lying next to the <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nited States,</hi> I choſe to make it the Subject of this Letter, deſigning to give thee an Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of <hi>Venice, Genoua, Lucca,</hi> and the Reſt in Order.</p>
                  <p>Know then, that <hi>Helvetia</hi> or <hi>Swiſſerland</hi> was once a <hi>Province</hi> of <hi>Germany,</hi> but now 'tis a <hi>Commonwealth</hi> ſubſiſting by it ſelf, and not ſubject to any Foreign Power. It is divided into Thirteen <hi>Cantons</hi> or <hi>Provinces.</hi> I will not trouble thee with the Names of each Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrich,
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:102965:95"/>or with their ſeveral Characters. The whole Country in general looks like a great Bunch of Rocks and Mountains, ſeparated by ſmall but very pleaſant Valleys. And though the Mountains ſeem rough, yet their Tops and Brows flouriſh no leſs with all ſorts of Trees and Herbage, than the faireſt Plains. The Inhabitants nouriſh abundance of Sheep on them, beſides Goats, Hinds, Horſes, with many other Kinds of Beaſts. For there is great Plenty of Animals in this Country, both Wild and Tame. The Air is piercing and ſerene; the Soil though not of it ſelf fertile, yet is made ſo by Induſtry of the Inhabitants. In ſome Parts they have <hi>Vineyards</hi> which produce a <hi>Grape</hi> of wonderful Delicacy: The Wine of which is much eſteem'd in thoſe Parts. The Lakes alſo and Rivers abound with Fiſh of all ſorts. Neither is there any Scarcity of Fowls, or of any Thing elſe, which immediately ſerves the Neceſſities of Human Life. Only Things tending to Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xury, and other Kinds of Wantonneſs, are not to be found in this Happy Region. It is a ſecond <hi>Scythia</hi> or <hi>Tartary.</hi> And indeed the Inhabitants of <hi>Swiſſerland</hi> are thought to come out of thoſe more Northern Regions.</p>
                  <p>They have ever been Famous for their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincible Conſtancy and Valour in War. <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lius Caeſar</hi> himſelf was afraid of them, and built a Wall to hinder them from going into <hi>France</hi> or <hi>Gaul;</hi> when he remember'd that <hi>L. Caſſius</hi> a <hi>Roman Conſul</hi> was Vanquiſh'd by them, and his whole Army routed. Some Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:102965:95"/>affirm, that in the Times of Old, the Inhabitants of the North of <hi>Europe,</hi> were ſo prodigiouſly multiplied, that ſome of them were forced to ſeek new Seats. Wherefore ruſhing through <hi>Germany</hi> and paſſing the <hi>Rhine,</hi> they were met by the <hi>Gauls,</hi> whom they Overcame and Defeated. Upon which News the Neighbouring Nations being ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rified, ſent <hi>Embaſſadors</hi> to them, deſiring Peace. The <hi>Conquerors</hi> replied, They came not to wage War, or diſturb the Peace of Mankind: That they only ſought a Place to live in quietly, where they might manure the Ground, without hurting any Body. Then <hi>Helvetia</hi> was granted to them, where their Poſterity live to this Day.</p>
                  <p>As to the Manners of the Modern <hi>Swiſs,</hi> they anſwer exactly the ancient Character; being wholly addicted to War; hardy to bear all Inconveniencies of Hunger, Thirſt, Cold, and other Afflictions of Nature, Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence, Deſtiny, or Chance. A little Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney ſerves their Turn to defray the Expences of eating; their Diet being very plain and ordinary, conſiſting chiefly of Milk and Cheeſe. If they are chargeable in any Thing, 'tis in Wine and other ſtrong Liquors. For you ſhall find but mean and ſqualid Houſes and contemptible Furniture; and they wear Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments anſwerable to the Reſt: But they are given to Drinking above Meaſure. They will conſume whole Days and Nights ſucceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſively, without Intermiſſion, in their drunken Debauches. Nor can any Friendſhip be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:102965:96"/>among them, but over their Cups. For, he who drinks moſt, and is moſt Fro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lickſome and Debonaire, he is taken for a Man of Integrity. Whereas he that ſeems timorous of his Health, or makes any frivo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous Excuſes, is look'd upon as a ſneaking Fellow, not worthy of ſuch good Company. Nay, ſometimes their Madneſs grows to that heighth, as to ſet a Dagger to his Threat, who refuſes to pledge in his Turn.</p>
                  <p>And yet after all this Reproach, it muſt be confeſs'd, That theſe People are very Prudent and Circumſpect, both in their Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate and Publick Affairs. For, notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Pleaſure they take in liberal Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potations, yet every Man, when the Frolick is over, is intent on his Buſineſs, uſing dou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Induſtry and Diligence, to make good the Expences of his laſt Vanity. They Work to Drink, and Drink that they may better Work again. So in the Publick, 'tis evident, that they are not defective in Policy, ſince they have been able for ſo many Centuries of Years, to maintain their Union, and Confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derated Liberties, againſt ſo many Princes, who have endeavour'd to bring them under a Foreign Yoke: And not only ſo, but ſuch is the Singularity of their Conduct, that the moſt mighty <hi>Monarchs</hi> in <hi>Europe</hi> are glad to enter into a League with them, and ſend Yearly vaſt Sums of Money.</p>
                  <p>Thou wilt not, after what I have ſaid, expect to find in <hi>Swiſſerland</hi> the Riches of <hi>Arabia</hi> and <hi>Babylon;</hi> nor the reſt of the Lu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xious
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:102965:96"/>and Magnificent Superfluities of the <hi>East.</hi> The Situation of the Country, and Nature of the Soil, denies theſe glittering Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities. It is ſufficient that it brings forth e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough to Nouriſh the Inhabitants.</p>
                  <p>They fear no Foreign Invaſion, both on the Account of this National Poverty, and the Inacceſſible Heights of the <hi>Alpes,</hi> with which they are on all ſides environ'd as by a Wall. Add to this, the invincible Reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the People, who abhor and fear Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection more than Death it ſelf. So that no <hi>Prince</hi> in <hi>Europe</hi> dares, or thinks it worth his while to carry a War into this Country; knowing, that if he ſhou'd conquer it, the Revenues, with all the Spoil of his new<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten Poſſeſſions, would not counterbalance the Expences of one ſhort Campaign. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides their Union is ſo ſtrict and cloſe, that it is almoſt impoſſible to break or diſſolve it. Then, they have ſome very ſtrong Cities, Caſtles, Forts, and other Places of Defence, which wou'd give no ſmall Diverſion and Incumbrance to him who ſhould undertake ſuch an Expedition. In fine, ſuch are their Circumſtances, That all the Courts round about them, think it ſafer to court this un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tameable Nation, than to threaten or huff them.</p>
                  <p>I will relate to thee a Story by way of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance or Example. From whence thou may'ſt comprehend more clearly the Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour of this People.</p>
                  <pb n="168" facs="tcp:102965:97"/>
                  <p>In former Times, as I have already ſaid, <hi>Swiſſerland</hi> was a <hi>Province</hi> of the <hi>German Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire,</hi> or at leaſt reputed ſo. And there were certain <hi>Prefects</hi> or <hi>Governours</hi> ſet over them by <hi>Caeſar,</hi> on ſucceeding another. Some of theſe, for their Inſolence, were driven out of the Nation; others were kill'd by Reaſon of their Tyrannous and cruel Practices. Among the reſt, one of theſe <hi>Governours,</hi> being diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſted at a certain <hi>Swiſs,</hi> commanded him to be York'd with Oxen that drew Burdens in a Cart. But when neither by fair nor foul Means they could force him to this vile Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſcenſion, he commanded his Eyes to be put out. Which was done accordingly. This was murmur'd at: But being the firſt Eſſay of his Cruel Diſpoſition, they wink'd at it.</p>
                  <p>A while after, the ſame <hi>Governour</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded a Woman, in her Husband's Abſence, to prepare a hot Bath for him. Which when the chaſte Matron refus'd to perform, till her Husband came home, he ſtruck her dead with an Axe. This alſo, though heightning the Choler of the <hi>Swiſs,</hi> was paſs'd by, in Meditation of future Revenge.</p>
                  <p>At laſt he grew ſo fooliſhly proud and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perious, that walking one Day in the Streets of the City, he ſtuck his Cane in the Ground, and plac'd his <hi>Turbant</hi> or <hi>Bonnet</hi> thereon; commanding all that paſs'd by to give Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour to it. Which when a certain honeſt <hi>Swiſs</hi> refus'd to do, he commanded him to ſtrike off an <hi>Apple</hi> from his Son's Head with a Short from his Croſs-bow. The good Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:102965:97"/>for a long Time refuſed thus to hazard his Son's Life. But being overcome by the Tyrant's importunate Menaces, he rather ventur'd to truſt to Providence the Life of his Son, than to Sacrifice both that and his own to the Implacable Malice of a <hi>Barbari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an.</hi> So he ſhot, and hit the <hi>Apple</hi> off with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out touching his Son's Head. The <hi>Governour</hi> ſeeing this, and taking notice that he brought two Arrows with him, asked him the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of it. To whom the <hi>Swiſs</hi> anſwered, <hi>If I had ſhot amiſs and hurt my Son with the first Arrow, I was reſolved to have pierced thy Heart with the ſecond.</hi> Upon this, all the People gave a Shout, and running together, ſeis'd upon the <hi>Governour,</hi> and tore him to Pieces. Neither would they ever afterwards endure or admit any Man into their Cities, from the <hi>Emperor,</hi> unleſs he came in the Quality of an <hi>Embaſſador.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Serene Miniſter,</hi> if theſe Memoirs are in the leaſt acceptable to thee, 'tis but to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, and thou ſhalt find I have a Stock not eaſie to be exhauſted.</p>
                  <p>Adieu, adieu, for the preſent. May the Curtains of <hi>God's Pavilion</hi> be unfurl'd about us, to skreen us from the Injuries of <hi>Daemons</hi> who hunt by Night for Mortals: For, 'tis now their Hour.</p>

                  <p>I Could hardly believe my own Eyes, when I firſt read thy Letter, and underſtood that thou art turn'd <hi>Husbandman</hi> at laſt, and ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led in a Place the moſt delectable on Earth, the very Center and Rendezvouz of all Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures, and whatſoever is agreeable to Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tals. Thou art a wary Man, reſolved to be ſure of one <hi>Paradiſe</hi> at leaſt, though it be by <hi>Mortgaging</hi> thy Title to the other. Thou wilt not ſuffer <hi>God Almighty</hi> to go upon Tick with thee, nor truſt all his Promiſes for <hi>Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven</hi> in Reverſion. Yet I cannot diſcommend thy Cautiouſneſs. We know not what ſhall befall us after <hi>Death;</hi> and therefore Nature prompts us to ſecure to our Selves ſome ſhare of <hi>Happineſs</hi> in this Life, and to ante<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>date the Uncertainties of a Future Bliſs, by carving out our <hi>own Heaven</hi> on this ſide the <hi>Grave.</hi> However, I wiſh thou may'ſt not ſurfeit on thy preſent Enjoyments, and ſo render thy <hi>Soul</hi> incapable of the Voyage to <hi>Eternal Beatitude.</hi> I tell thee, <hi>My Dgnet,</hi> thou art a bold Man to venture on a Place by Choice which the <hi>Meſſenger of God</hi> pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſely ſhunn'd as the moſt dangerous on <hi>Earth.</hi> But I wou'd not diſcourage thee. That City was then in the Hands of <hi>Infidels,</hi>
                     <pb n="171" facs="tcp:102965:98"/>a <hi>Seat of Profanation and Idolatry;</hi> now 'tis ſanctified by the Preſence of <hi>True Believers,</hi> by the Preaching of the Law brought down from <hi>Heaven,</hi> and by the <hi>Moſchs</hi> of <hi>perfect Holineſs.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>As for the Manner of Life thou haſt made Choice of, I highly applaud it, as the moſt Primitive, Innocent, Delightful, and Happy above all others. Many great <hi>Princes</hi> and <hi>Kings</hi> have exchanged the <hi>Toilſome Glory and Royal Fatigues of Empire,</hi> for the ſweet Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quility and Eaſe of a Country Farm, and wholſome Exerciſes of Agriculture. Thus <hi>Diocleſian</hi> a <hi>Roman Emperor</hi> quitted his Throne for the ſake of a Private Life; and thoſe Hands which had been accuſtomed to weild the <hi>Scepter,</hi> became at laſt voluntarily fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar with the <hi>Spade,</hi> the <hi>Plough,</hi> and the <hi>Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row.</hi> So the <hi>Grand Cyrus, Monarch</hi> of the <hi>Perſians, uſed to boast of the Gardens planted and ſow'd with his own Hands.</hi> And 'tis cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, that the <hi>Fabii,</hi> the <hi>Lentuli,</hi> the <hi>Cicero</hi>'s the <hi>Piſo</hi>'s, with many of the <hi>Noblest Families</hi> in Ancient <hi>Rome,</hi> derived their Names from thoſe Kind of <hi>Vegetables</hi> which they ſignifie, and which their <hi>Fathers</hi> took Delight in Planting.</p>
                  <p>How many Great Authors have writ in Praiſe of <hi>Husbandry? Attalus</hi> and <hi>Archelaus,</hi> Two <hi>Kings,</hi> extoll'd it: <hi>Xenophon</hi> and <hi>Mago,</hi> two Generals, patroniz'd it, and <hi>Oppian</hi> the Poet celebrates it in Verſe. Beſides <hi>Cato, Varro, Pliny, Columella, Virgil,</hi> and many o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers. Some have plac'd Supreme Felicity
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:102965:99"/>in this kind of Life. <hi>Virgil</hi> pronounces Huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bandmen Fortunate, and <hi>Horace</hi> calls them <hi>Bleſſed.</hi> Hence it was, that the <hi>Delphick Oracle declar'd a certain Man nam'd</hi> Aglaus <hi>to be the happiest of all Mortals, becauſe he was buſied in Nothing but manuring and culti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vating a little Farm, never moleſting himſelf with vain Cares or Paſſions, nor encreaſing the Miſeries of Human Life by tampering with fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign and unneceſſary Pleaſures, which though full of Blandiſhments and ſweet in the Front, yet carry a Sting in their Tail, embittering all our Joys.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thou art ſituated in the moſt pleaſant Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>urb of <hi>Damaſcus;</hi> for I have ſurvey'd that City, and all its Precincts, with no ſmall Curioſity. The Houſe is encompaſs'd with lovely Gardens and Meadows. It was for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly the Seat of <hi>Abul Mecharib</hi> the famous Shepherd, who took Sanctuary there from the Perſecution of <hi>Iſmael Beglerbegh</hi> of <hi>Diar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>behir.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thou know'ſt the Story, and I need ſay no more, than to wiſh thee as good Fortune in poſſeſſing that rich Spot of Ground, as he had, who, as 'tis recorded in the Regiſter of <hi>Damaſcus,</hi> died worth a Hundred Purſes of Gold, moſt of it got by the Encreaſe of his Cattel in thoſe <hi>Lucky Fields.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>For my part, I cannot pretend to Skill in theſe Things; but it appears to me like a good <hi>Omen,</hi> that thy Predeceſſor was ſo pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſperous in that Farm. I adviſe thee to take his Meaſures, and ſtock thy Ground with
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:102965:99"/>Sheep, Oxen, Camels, Horſes, and other Animals of Profit. Think no Scorn, to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low an Employment ennobled by the Exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples of <hi>Romulus</hi> and <hi>Rhemus,</hi> the firſt Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders of the <hi>Roman Empire;</hi> of <hi>Paris</hi> the Son of <hi>Priamus;</hi> of <hi>Anchiſes</hi> the Father of <hi>Aene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as;</hi> of <hi>Endymion</hi> the beloved of <hi>Diana,</hi> who were all Herdſmen or Shepherds. So was <hi>Polyphemus</hi> and <hi>Argus.</hi> So was <hi>Apollo,</hi> who tended the Flocks of <hi>Admetus</hi> King of <hi>Theſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly.</hi> What ſhall I ſay of <hi>Mercury</hi> the firſt In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venter of <hi>Hautboy,</hi> and <hi>Prince of Shepherds,</hi> and of <hi>Proteus</hi> another <hi>Divinity?</hi> Was not <hi>Abrahim,</hi> the Father of <hi>Muſſulmans,</hi> a Herdſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, and <hi>Moyſes</hi> the <hi>Prophet</hi> familiar with <hi>God,</hi> and <hi>David</hi> the <hi>Prince of Poets?</hi> In a Word, <hi>my Friend,</hi> the moſt illuſtrious <hi>Heroes</hi> among the ancient <hi>Greeks, Romans,</hi> and other Nations, were all Keepers of Sheep, Goats, Oxen, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> as the <hi>Arabians</hi> are at this Day with the <hi>Tartars,</hi> and other Nations of the <hi>East.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Doubtleſs, the Rural Life, as it is the moſt Ancient, ſo it affords the ſincereſt Pleaſures, and moſt unrepented Joys in Nature; pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided a Man enjoys it with Innocence and Juſtice. But, I would have thee avoid the common Temptations to which this Kind of Life is more expos'd than any other; that is, Hunting and Fowling. Theſe are really de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtable Exerciſes, Tragical Sports, and all<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together inhuman. It is a Labour unwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy of Men to watch from Day to Day, and and one Night after another, the Haunts of

                     <hi>To</hi> Achmet Cupriogli, <hi>the Moſt Exalted and Sage</hi> Vizir Azem.</head>
                  <p>THE Face of Affairs here in the <hi>Weſt</hi> is now quite changed. A <hi>General Peace</hi> is eſtabliſhed between the <hi>Nazarene Princes</hi> and <hi>States. France,</hi> which a while ago was at Mortal Jarrs with the <hi>Hollanders, Spain,</hi> and the <hi>German Empire,</hi> is lately reconcil'd to them; whilſt new Friendſhips and Alliances have baniſh'd all Thoughts of former Enmi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties and Feuds. <hi>This Year commences a Civil Jubilee in</hi> Europe.</p>
                  <p>There has been a <hi>Treaty</hi> of <hi>Peace</hi> in Agita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion at <hi>Nimeguen,</hi> and Conferences held about it any Time theſe Four or Five Years; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of I formerly gave a Hint in one of my Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters to the <hi>Port.</hi> The Concluſion of it is ow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the <hi>Powerful Mediation</hi> of the <hi>King</hi> of <hi>Great Britain,</hi> who is made <hi>Guarantee</hi> of the <hi>Articles:</hi> And the Submiſſive Addreſſes of the <hi>Biſhop</hi> of <hi>Strasburg</hi> to the <hi>King</hi> of <hi>France,</hi> contributed not a little to the <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſal Agreement.</hi> For, this <hi>Great Monarch</hi> is ſlow in his Advances toward an Accommodation with thoſe who have injur'd <hi>Him</hi> or his <hi>Allies.</hi> He affects to imitate the ſtately Reſervedneſs of the <hi>Eaſtern Princes,</hi> thinking <hi>His Majeſty</hi>
                     <pb n="177" facs="tcp:102965:101"/>would be violated, ſhou'd he condeſcend too ſoon, and on too eaſie Terms, to the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſals of his Neighbours. He has learn'd this from the <hi>Maxims</hi> of the <hi>Sublime Port,</hi> the <hi>Refuge of Mankind,</hi> whoſe Arms are ever open to receive and embrace all that ſue for the <hi>Grand Signior</hi>'s Friendſhip and Protection, in a Way not entrenching on the Glory of the <hi>Ottoman Houſe,</hi> a <hi>Family</hi> deſtin'd to Subdue the World.</p>
                  <p>This Temper of the <hi>French King</hi> is ſo well known and obſerved in theſe Paris, that he has got a new Character by it, both among Foreigners and thoſe of his own Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. For they ſpare not to call him <hi>The most Chriſtian Turk,</hi> by way of Mockery; and this is the <hi>Satyrical Style</hi> even of his Subjects in their Seditious Cabals, when they are a little warm'd with Wine, and each Man as Great as a <hi>King</hi> himſelf, in his own Conceit.</p>
                  <p>By the ſwift Flaſhes of <hi>Lightning,</hi> which cauſe the Heart to pant, and dazle the Eyes of Mortals; by the aſtoniſhing Noiſe of <hi>Thun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der,</hi> which raiſes the Vapours of the Spleen, and fills us with Hypocondriack Dread, I ſwear, the <hi>King</hi> of <hi>France is a great Hero,</hi> and deſerves the <hi>Honour</hi> which theſe <hi>Infidels</hi> have unfeignedly done him, in lik'ning him to the undoubted Arbiter of the Earth. He re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally determines the Differences and Quarrels of a great Part of it. And though he be a <hi>Chriſtian</hi> in <hi>Profeſſion,</hi> and ſtyl'd, <hi>The Eldeſt
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:102965:102"/>Son of the Church;</hi> yet he is no Enemy to the <hi>Followers</hi> of <hi>Mahomet,</hi> who vouchſafe him their Friendſhip. Thou know'ſt he is the moſt <hi>Primitive Allie</hi> of the <hi>Ottoman Empire,</hi> among the <hi>Weſtern Princes</hi> of the <hi>Law of Jeſus.</hi> He has eſtabliſh'd a more remote Friendſhip, for the ſake of Commerce, and ſpreading his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nown, with the <hi>Grand Mogul,</hi> and the <hi>King</hi> of <hi>Perſia.</hi> His Fame ſtrikes all the <hi>East</hi> with Admiration and Reſpect: For they have heard of his continual <hi>Victories</hi> and ſucceſs<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful <hi>Exploits</hi> even to the utmoſt Borders of the <hi>Continent.</hi> Yet the ſame Fortune pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cures him only the <hi>Spight</hi> and <hi>Envy</hi> of the <hi>Princes</hi> in the <hi>West.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>However, they are glad to diſſemble their Malice at this Juncture, and enter into an Agreement with him, almoſt upon his own Terms.</p>
                  <p>The Treaty between <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Holland</hi> was publiſh'd in this City on the 1ſt of the 10th <hi>Moon,</hi> the Year precedent. Now to aſſure the World that there is a perfect Amity and Peace, the <hi>Dutch</hi> have ſent their Embaſſadors Extraordinary to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge, That the <hi>King</hi> has preferred the Repoſe of <hi>Chriſtendom</hi> to the Glory which his Victorious Arms acquir'd him; and that the <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nited States of the Low-Countries</hi> being the firſt who have felt the Effects of his Generoſity, they thought themſelves obliged to prevent others in the Earlineſs of their Application. Yeſterday
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:102965:102"/>was alſo publiſh'd the Peace between <hi>France</hi> and the <hi>Emperor.</hi>

                  <head>
                     <hi>To</hi> Mehmet, <hi>an</hi> Exil'd Eunuch, <hi>at</hi> Al-Caire <hi>in</hi> Egypt.</head>
                  <p>THere are certain Critical Periods in our Lives, whether ordain'd by <hi>Fate,</hi> or falling out in an Eternal Circulation of <hi>Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,</hi> I am not able to determine. But this I perceive, That at ſuch Seaſons, ſomething very ſtrange and unuſual happens to us, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove, or beſide, the Ordinary Courſe of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; or, at leaſt, appearing ſo to me. I will not pretend to Unravel the <hi>Web</hi> of <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtiny;</hi> or deſcribe the Incomprehenſible Fine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of that Artifice, which has fram'd the Worlds. I will not undertake to diſcover the <hi>Secrets</hi> of <hi>God,</hi> the <hi>Myſteries</hi> of <hi>Nature,</hi> and thoſe Things which are, under a Seal, ſhut up from Mortals, in Inſcrutable Dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. I will not, by a Vain Preſumption, and Impious Arrogance, claim to my ſelf the Right of <hi>Omniſcience,</hi> and dive into other Men's Conſtitutions and Thoughts. Suffice it, that I comprehend my own.</p>
                  <p>Thou know'ſt, My <hi>Mehmet,</hi> that I have been a Man of many Circumſtances, ſubject to Various Changes and Viciſſitudes in this Mortal State. My Life has been Alternate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Checquer'd with Good and Evil. Virtue and Vice have had their Turns in the <hi>Series</hi>
                     <pb n="181" facs="tcp:102965:103"/>of my Actions: Proſperity and Adverſity in the Courſe of my Years. And I would fain find out the Man that can, with Truth, boaſt the Contrary. Doubtleſs, we are all born to the Adventures which happen in the Pell<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mell of Human Converſation. <hi>Fates-Errant</hi> encounter one another: Sometimes they are Agreeable, and Complaiſant: At other Sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons they will Claſh and Tilt, break Lances, draw Swords; and all the Weapons of <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture</hi>'s Pride and Fury ſhall be us'd in mere Defence of Idioſyncraſies, Conceits, Antipa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thies, Self-Intereſt, Preſervation; or any Thing, but what is Generous and Good.</p>
                  <p>O Horrid State of Men! A Life to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plor'd, beyond the Salvage Courſe of Lyons, Tygers, Wolves, and other Beaſts of Prey; who always, in Extreameſt Hunger, ſpare their Proper <hi>Species!</hi> Yet Man, in Perfect Wantonneſs, devours his Brother, and glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries in his Cruelty and Injuſtice.</p>
                  <p>As for me, I have not been guilty of any of theſe Black Crimes, which make a Riot in the Tranquility of the <hi>Soul,</hi> diſturb its Peace, darken its Light, and cover it with a Cloud of Guilty, Deſperate Thoughts. No: If I have been Enemy to any Body, it has been to my ſelf. The very <hi>Beasts</hi> cannot challeng me with Oppreſſion, or any Barba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous Uſage: Much leſs wou'd I torment One <hi>Individual</hi> of our Humane Race. But I have had my Frailties, as well as other Men; and there's all can be ſaid of it. Thou art ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with my Temper; and no Body
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:102965:104"/>knows any worſe. 'Tis true, I have had to do with Abundance of People in my Life-Time. I have Bull'd it, Lyon'd, Lamb'd, and ſometimes Fox'd it in the World. I have always purſu'd the Chace of <hi>Nature.</hi> Come Life, come Death, I have made no Baulks in the Appointments of <hi>Fate;</hi> or ever put the <hi>Eternal Deſtiny</hi> to a Stand. I never halted, boggl'd, or fram'd a Stumble, at a Generous and Noble Action, a Bold and <hi>God</hi>-like Enterprize. But, from my Cradle, I diſdain'd and cheriſh'd Infant-Abhorrences for an Inhuman, Barbarous, Perfidious, Cow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ardly Thought.</p>
                  <p>Indeed, I have been too great a Lover of Good Company; too eaſie, flexible, and free in drinking Wine, and other Inebriating Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quors; whoſe Uſe is taught from <hi>Heaven,</hi> and is the Genuine Product of <hi>Eternal Reaſon.</hi> But the Exceſs is, ſure, deriv'd from <hi>Hell,</hi> the Seat of <hi>Everlaſting Evil, Vanity,</hi> and <hi>Error.</hi> And yet, to whom, or to what Cauſe, or Principles, ſhall I aſcribe the many Extrava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gances of this Kind, that I have committed? I! that have ſuffer'd the <hi>Thaws</hi> of a Thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand <hi>Putrid Fevers;</hi> let all my Radical, Eſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial, Neceſſary Juices and Humours, (tho' never ſo well and firmly Congeal'd, by the Force of an Excellent and Happy Conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Body) melt and diſſolve away, in Horrid Fluxes, Sweats, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> rather than baulk my Friends, or the <hi>Grand Signior</hi>'s Cauſe; Rather than Sneak away from Boon Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions, in a Principle of Sordid Prudence!
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:102965:104"/>To ſpeak all, I am no Starter from the Juice of the Grape, when 'tis handed to me by Men of Senſe, and a Good Humour: Eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially, when it is to ſerve my Sovereign. And I know not how to perform that Service better, at ſome Times, than by giving Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture an <hi>Eſcapade,</hi> as the <hi>French</hi> call it, from the too Severe Reſtraints of Conſtant Sobrie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. I was not ſent to <hi>Paris,</hi> that I ſhould lead the Life of an <hi>Hadgi;</hi> But to dive into the Secrets of the <hi>Infidels:</hi> Which a Man can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not do better, than over a Glaſs of Generous Wine: For, that unlocks the Cabinets of the Heart, and reveals all Secrets.</p>
                  <p>I tell thee plainly, <hi>Mehmet;</hi> I drink Wine liberally, and frequently; finding no <hi>Devil</hi> in the Quality of it, but only in the Exceſs. And ſuch a <hi>Devil</hi> appear'd to me laſt Week, in the Night Time. I had Carous'd it, like a <hi>German,</hi> for ſome whole Days together, in Order to the Carrying on an Intrigue of Moment: Yet I found my ſelf no Ways diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>order'd; neither cou'd any Body elſe per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive, by one falſe Step in my Carriage, that I was more than Civilly and Chearful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Elevated.</p>
                  <p>It was the Hotteſt Seaſon of all the Year; which prompted me, and Thoſe that kept me Company, to Regale our ſelves after the moſt Refreſhing Manner we could invent. Our Drink was an Artificial Mixture of the Wine, Water, the Juice of Limons, Odori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferous and Cephalick Herbs, Fruits, and whatſoever elſe could render it Cooling and
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:102965:105"/>Delicious to the Palate; Medicinal to the Brain, Heart, and Stomach.</p>
                  <p>I will not detain thee in Impatience, with any more Particularities. Only, I thought it neceſſary to acquaint thee with the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod of my Drinking; that thou may'ſt form the more Accurate Judgment on the Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence, which I am going to relate.</p>
                  <p>It was in the Evening of the Day dedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated to <hi>Saturn</hi> by the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> (which is the ſame as <hi>Jews Sabbath:</hi>) Our Drinking end<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Day before, and I, in a very Melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>choly Humour, went to Bed. I ſlept till Mid-night profoundly; but then awaking, I was ſurpriz'd with the Apparition of an <hi>Old Man,</hi> much reſembling my ſelf. He ſeem'd to look very Studious, and full of Care; ſit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting in a Chair, and leaning on the Table, in juſt ſuch an Habit as I wear, with ſuch a Beard, and every Thing that can be call'd my True Portraicture. I lay Muſing, and Gazing, for the Space of about Twenty Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nutes, on this Amazing Object. I muſter'd up all that little <hi>Philoſophy</hi> I am Maſter of, to conſider the Nature of the <hi>Phantaſm.</hi> I argu'd with my ſelf, ſummon'd all my Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, <hi>Sub-poena'd</hi> my Senſes, ſate up in the Bed, took my <hi>Polvita,</hi> reach'd my Head as far as I could, without Tumbling out of the Bed; and the more I rouz'd my ſelf, the plainer did this Familiar Figure of my ſelf appear, by the Light of a Lamp, which al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways burns in my Chamber.</p>
                  <pb n="185" facs="tcp:102965:105"/>
                  <p>Yet, being Naturally Incredulous of the Common Stories of <hi>Ghoſts, Apparitions, Hob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>goblins, &amp;c.</hi> I ſtill ſuſpected, that I was ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, all this while, in a Dream; or, at leaſt, if awake, that my Imagination was Vitiated, and Impos'd upon. Wherefore, to ſatisfie my ſelf more throughly. I jump'd out of the Bed. No ſooner had my Feet touch'd the Floor of the Chamber, but a Sacred Horror poſſeſs'd my Nerves: I trembl'd at the now more Apparent <hi>Viſion.</hi> However, reſuming Cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage, and reſigning my ſelf to <hi>God,</hi> I went forward, and approach'd ſo near the Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couth <hi>Spectre,</hi> that it was within the Reach of my Hand, which I ſtretch'd forth, to touch it; thinking this Way to undeceive my ſelf. But, O my <hi>Mehmet!</hi> No Tongue, nor Pen, can e'er expreſs the Dreadful <hi>Metamor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phoſis</hi> I ſaw. For, inſtead of the ſame Face which I ſaw before, my Eyes were now ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coſted with the Dreadful Countenance of a <hi>Lyon,</hi> gnaſhing his Teeth, and darting perfect Sparks of Fire from his Looks; beſides the Horrid Twirling of his Head, and Manly Beard; with all the other Natural Motions of that Animal, in its Fierceneſs.</p>
                  <p>I know not what would have become of me, if a Good-natur'd <hi>Ape</hi> had not come in to my Relief; who peep'd and grinn'd upon me, over the <hi>Lyon</hi>'s Shoulders. Nay, thought I, if you are ſo Merry in ſuch Company, I will not diſturb you, Good Mr. <hi>Ape!</hi> And ſo I fairly took my Leave, turn'd my Back, and went to Bed again.</p>
                  <pb n="186" facs="tcp:102965:106"/>
                  <p>It is my Nature, not to be afraid, or ſhrink from the Imagination of a <hi>Ghost,</hi> or <hi>Spectre,</hi> or what you pleaſe to call it. (For, I am ſatisfied, there is no more than Pure Imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation in it.) But, I retir'd in Complaiſance to my own Fancy, which, I perciev'd, was upon the Creative Frolick. Had I ſtood ſtill, perhaps a <hi>Dragon</hi> had ſtarted next, or ſome more Dreadful Animal. Or, 'tis poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, I had been terrify'd with an Herd of <hi>Lynxes, Leopards, Tygers, Bears,</hi> and what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever elſe is Salvage and Moroſe in Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. For, I tell thee, I was then in a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, to paint the Walls with any Figure, which ſhould riſe within my Over-heated Brains.</p>
                  <p>At ſuch a Time, there are Emiſſions from the Eyes, forcible as the Pencils of a Lim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner. A Man's Fermented Optick Nerves will draw the Portraicture of <hi>Saints,</hi> or <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils,</hi> or any Thing that can be nam'd, except the <hi>Everlaſting SO<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>RCE</hi> of <hi>All Things.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>HE,</hi> indeed, is altogether <hi>Ineffable;</hi> who cannot be expreſs'd by Tongue, or Pen, or by any other Way, but Humble <hi>Negatives.</hi> There runs a Silent Fountain by the Door of his Tremendous and Inviolate Seceſs: Of which the Caſtrate Angel drinks, at a certain Set, Appointed Seaſons; and then the Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe is all Inebriated with the Reverſion of his Cup. For, it is the Ceremony of the <hi>Court</hi> Above, that he ſhould leave no Snuffs, or <hi>Supernaculums</hi> behind him; but ſcatter 'em abroad, to treat the Thirſty World below.
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:102965:106"/>Bleſſed is the Man, who has a Share in this Celeſtial Compotation.</p>
                  <p>Pardon me, for thus Digreſſing in Perfect Piety. For, we ought not to Name the <hi>High</hi> and <hi>Holy ONE,</hi> without Additional Reverences.</p>
                  <p>In ſhort, I lay but the Space of Half an Hour, gazing on this Odd Kind of <hi>Appari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi> which had now reſum'd my Phyſiognomy again. At laſt it vaniſh'd all on a Sudden, whil'ſt my Eyes were intently fix'd upon it. It is impoſſible to expreſs exactly, the Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner how it diſappear'd. But, according to the Beſt <hi>Idea,</hi> and Propereſt Form of Words I have, it ſeem'd to be diſpers'd, juſt as a Smoak or Vapour is Reſolv'd or Rarified in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Purer Air. Or, as the <hi>Moon</hi>'s Pale Light, which ſhines within your Chamber, is unawares extinguiſh'd, in Appearance, by ſome Intervening Cloud. So did this <hi>Spectre</hi> fade, and melt away.</p>
                  <p>If thou wilt have my Judgment in this Caſe, I think there was Nothing in it, but the Pure Force and Energy of my Over-agitated Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits; which darted the Impreſſion of their own <hi>Idea's</hi> on the next Solid Body, that was within the Sphere of their Activity. The Air it ſelf, at ſuch a Time, is more than or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinarily Flexible, and Ductile: It yields by Sympathy, and is conformable to the Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſient Image. It helps to patch up the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects, and Ragged Forms of our Frail Fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies. Millions of Atoms run to relieve the Weaken'd, Half-ſpent Efflux of their Attra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:102965:107"/>and Magnetick Kindred-Particles. Pell-mell they ruſh together, yet fall into their Proper Ranks; without Diſorder, or Confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion. Every one ſtops a Gap, prevents a <hi>Vacuum;</hi> and ſo the Abortive Figure is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleated. <hi>Nature</hi> is ſometimes pleas'd, thus to divert her ſelf with Strange <hi>Chimaera's.</hi> Even ſo this World of Ours was form'd, if we may believe <hi>Democritus,</hi> and <hi>Epicurus.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thou and I, my Dear <hi>Mehmet,</hi> are but Two Different Lumps of Particles; Tack'd, and Stitch'd, and Glew'd together, by the Bird-lime of <hi>Chance.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I wiſh, when that Glew ſhall be diſſolv'd, we may ſcamper at Large, in the Endleſs Element of Light.</p>

                  <p>MY Mind is at this Time in an <hi>Aſtral</hi> Diſpoſition, as they call it, Tender and Receptive of any Impreſſions. I am like a young <hi>Libertine</hi> newly converted from his lewd Courſes and Impiety; whoſe Heart, a devout Compunction and Remorſe of Sin, has ſoften'd, open'd, and as it were diſſolv'd like Wax: So that it becomes equally capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of any new Stamp, whether of Vice or Virtue. Thus pliable and ductile am I at preſent, through a kind of Fatal Supineneſs or Inactivity of Spirit, which takes from me the Power of forming one ſubſtantial, lively Thought of my own, or exerting any ſtrong and laborious Act of Reaſon; yet at the ſame Time lays me open to the Invaſion of all Fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign <hi>Idea</hi>'s, and expoſes me to be taken Captive by every bold Argument, or ſly Ambuſh of Human Sophiſtry. In a Word, I am of a ſudden ſo weak and unmortified, that I dare not enter the Field of Religious Controverſies, or ſo much as ſtand and behold the Battel between the different <hi>Sects</hi> that are perpetually diſputing againſt one another in the World; leſt a random Shot from one Party or other ſhould reach my unguarded Soul, and give my Intellect a Mortal Wound.</p>
                  <pb n="190" facs="tcp:102965:108"/>
                  <p>Forbearing therefore to enlarge in giving thee a particular Account of all the Nice Dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferences that are of late Years ſprung up a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong theſe <hi>Weſtern Infidels,</hi> in matters of Opinion and <hi>Church-Diſcipline;</hi> I will only inform thee in ſhort, That thoſe who firſt Revolted from the <hi>Biſhop</hi> of <hi>Rome,</hi> ſtill re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd an Inviolable <hi>Attach</hi> and Dutiful Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verence for their own <hi>National Biſhops;</hi> ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting to their Conduct, and owning them as <hi>Fathers</hi> and Guides of their Reſpective <hi>Churches.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But as there is no End of Diviſions, when once the Unity of a People is broken, which is the only Cement that faſtens all Societies; ſo this firſt Separation from the <hi>Roman Epiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>copacy,</hi> ſoon begat another from all <hi>Epiſcopacy</hi> in general, through moſt of the <hi>Reform'd</hi> or <hi>Proteſtant</hi> Nations in <hi>Europe.</hi> Eſpecially in <hi>Scotland,</hi> the Theatre of many Bickerings and Animoſities on this Account, of bloody Combats and Civil Wars; and finally, now in this Year, the Stage of a <hi>Barbarous Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der</hi> committed on the Perſon of the <hi>Chief Mufti</hi> or <hi>Archbiſhop</hi> of that Nation.</p>
                  <p>He was a Man of an Accurate and Extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary Spirit, and in his very Youth gave early Marks of a refin'd <hi>Genius,</hi> in <hi>Sciences;</hi> to which he brought no ſmall Reputation and Honour, through the Vaſtneſs of his Abilities, his profound Judgment, and dexte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous Sagacity in all Things that he under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>took.</p>
                  <pb n="191" facs="tcp:102965:108"/>
                  <p>This is the Character given him by thoſe of his Nation reſident here in <hi>Paris,</hi> of whom there are always great Numbers; and the <hi>Kings</hi> of <hi>France</hi> were formerly never without a ſelect Guard of <hi>Scots</hi> about their Perſons: Which Cuſtom had been obſerved ever ſince the Reigns of <hi>Charles</hi> the <hi>Great,</hi> and of <hi>Achaius King</hi> of the <hi>Scots;</hi> between whom this was agreed upon in a Solemn League, and was obſerved through the Reigns of One and Forty <hi>Kings</hi> of <hi>France,</hi> and Six and For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of <hi>Scotland.</hi> The <hi>Scots</hi> alſo us'd to ſend 'em Auxiliary Forces in Time of War. Nay ſo great Affection and ſo-conſtant the Fideli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of that People to the <hi>French,</hi> that when at one Time a War has threaten'd <hi>France,</hi> they have drawn it into their own Country, have ſuffer'd the Loſs of Ten Thouſand Men in one Battel, and ſeen their <hi>King</hi> taken Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive: At another Time, fighting for the <hi>French</hi> againſt the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> though inhabiting the ſame Iſland with themſelves, they have had Fourteen Thouſand of their Soldiers, with their <hi>King,</hi> kill'd upon the Spot.</p>
                  <p>And that Nothing might be wanting to confirm and eſtabliſh the Friendſhip of Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; it was cuſtomary to make reciprocal Marriages one with another, that ſo the <hi>French</hi> and <hi>Scotch</hi> Blood might be mutually mix'd in both Countries.</p>
                  <p>Thus <hi>Lewis</hi> XI. when he was <hi>Dauphin</hi> of <hi>France</hi> married <hi>Margaret</hi> the Daughter of <hi>James</hi> I. <hi>King</hi> of <hi>Scotland.</hi> At which Time, the <hi>Grandees</hi> and <hi>Courtiers</hi> of <hi>France,</hi> in Imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation

                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>orce of <hi>French</hi> Complaiſance) married above a Hundred and Forty <hi>Scotch</hi> Ladies of Illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrious Birth and Quality; among whom were Two <hi>Siſters</hi> of the <hi>Scotch Queen;</hi> one becoming Wife to the <hi>Duke</hi> of <hi>Little Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tagne;</hi> the other to the <hi>Count</hi> of <hi>Flanders.</hi> The <hi>Scotch Nobility</hi> on the other Hand, mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried many <hi>French Ladies</hi> of great Extraction, tranſporting them to <hi>Scotland,</hi> where they ſetled and bore Children.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Kings</hi> of <hi>France</hi> being mov'd with Gratitude for the frequent Aids and Good Offices they receiv'd from the <hi>Scots;</hi> as alſo regarding the Loſſes which the <hi>Scots</hi> had ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtained in their Quarrels, and the ſtrict Affi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities that were made between the <hi>Princes, Nobles,</hi> and other People of both Nations; reſolved to teſtifie to the World, how accept<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able this Obſequiouſneſs of the <hi>Scots</hi> was to them, by Honouring them with Benefits and Privileges above all other Nations.</p>
                  <p>Therefore ſome of the <hi>Scotch Grandees</hi> were made: <hi>Great Conſtables</hi> of <hi>France;</hi> which is the greateſt Office and Dignity in the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, next to that of the <hi>Soveraignty</hi> it ſelf. Others were made <hi>Marſhals, Dukes,</hi> and <hi>Peers</hi> of <hi>France, Generals</hi> of the <hi>French</hi> Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, <hi>Vice-Roys</hi> of Tributary <hi>Provinces</hi> and <hi>Kingdoms.</hi> All the <hi>Scots</hi> in general were had in high Honour and Eſteem at the <hi>French Court,</hi> and enjoy'd the ſame Rights and Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munities as the very Natives themſelves, by the ſpecial Grant of <hi>Henry</hi> II. But with
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:102965:109"/>this Condition, that they ſhould perſevere in their Fidelity and Friendſhip to the <hi>French:</hi> And that the <hi>French</hi> who dwelt in any Part of <hi>Scotland</hi> ſhould enjoy the ſame Rights and Privileges as the Natives of the Country. The <hi>Parliament</hi> of <hi>Paris</hi> ſubſcrib'd to this <hi>Grant;</hi> and it was confirm'd by <hi>Henry</hi> IV. about the year 1599.</p>
                  <p>Likewiſe <hi>Charles</hi> XI. confirmed to the <hi>Scotch</hi> Merchants all thoſe Privileges and Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munities which their Anceſtors had enjoy'd. That they ſhould be free from all Exactions, Impoſts and Cuſtoms which are uſually paid for Merchandiſes.</p>
                  <p>As to the Original Riſe of the <hi>Scotch</hi> Guards about the <hi>French</hi> King's Perſon; I will tell thee as briefly as I can.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Louis</hi> who acquir'd the Title of <hi>Saint,</hi> for Warring in Perſon againſt the <hi>Muſſulmans;</hi> when he march'd towards <hi>Paleſtine,</hi> appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Four and Twenty <hi>Scotch Soldiers</hi> to have the Guard of his Perſon Night and Day. <hi>Charles</hi> V. augmented their Number to Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venty Six; yet ſtill reſerving this Honour for the Firſt Four and Twenty, That they ſhould have the Command of the Reſt.</p>
                  <p>Thus the Cuſtody of the <hi>King's</hi> Body re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main'd with the <hi>Scots</hi> for the ſpace of Seven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty Years, and upwards. But <hi>Charles</hi> VII. being willing to oblige the <hi>French,</hi> appointed a Guard of them to be about his Perſon, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der one Standard; <hi>Lewis</hi> X. added another Standard; and <hi>Francis</hi> I. adjoyned a Third: Yet without entrenching on the Prerogatives
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:102965:110"/>of the Twenty Four <hi>Scots,</hi> which they ſtill enjoy'd by Right of Antiquity and Preſcripti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; as alſo by the Sanction of St. <hi>Louis,</hi> for whom the <hi>French</hi> profeſs a great Veneration. Theſe Twenty Four <hi>Scots</hi> kept the Keys of the <hi>Royal Palace</hi> after Sun-ſet. They alone guarded the <hi>King</hi> when he was in the <hi>Temple</hi> at <hi>Maſs.</hi> They alone carried the <hi>King,</hi> when the <hi>Laws</hi> of the <hi>Land,</hi> and the <hi>Ceremonies</hi> of <hi>State</hi> requir'd him to be carried on Men's Shoulders. They guarded the Ships, when the <hi>King</hi> went by Water. And to them were the Keys of every Town deliverd, through which the <hi>King</hi> paſs'd in his Travels by Land, with many other ſingular Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours.</p>
                  <p>But after the Death of <hi>Henry</hi> II. when the <hi>Eurl</hi> of <hi>Montgomery,</hi> the laſt Commander of the <hi>Scotch</hi> Guards was remov'd from his Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice, and a <hi>French Officer</hi> plac'd over them in his ſtead; that Command always fell into the Hands of <hi>French-men,</hi> who by degrees ſubſtituting thoſe of their own Nation in the Room of the <hi>Scots</hi> who died, it came to paſs at length, that there remain'd but a very few <hi>Scots</hi> in the Guards, and thoſe were bereft of all their ancient Privileges.</p>
                  <p>Pardon this tedious Digreſſion, <hi>Great Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triarch</hi> of the <hi>Faithful,</hi> ſince it contains ſome curious <hi>Memoirs</hi> in it, and I naturally fell into it by ſpeaking of the <hi>Scots</hi> who are very Nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merous in <hi>Paris</hi> to this Day; and from whom I learn'd the foregoing Character of their Murder'd <hi>Archbiſhop,</hi> who was the <hi>Prime Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triarch</hi>
                     <pb n="195" facs="tcp:102965:110"/>of all the Land; his Ordinary Title being, <hi>Archbiſhop</hi> of <hi>St. Andrews.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This great and higheſt <hi>Eccleſiastical</hi> Digni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty was given him by the preſent King of <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland,</hi> at his Return from a Twelve Years <hi>Exile,</hi> as a Debt to his Great Abilities, and a Reward of his Merits and Services, in la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring might and main to effect the <hi>King's Restauration.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>From the Moment that he acquir'd this Honour, ſuch as were equally Enemies to the Government of <hi>King's</hi> and <hi>Biſhops,</hi> perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted him with Slanders and Invectives. The Streets ſwarm'd with Libels againſt him and Mens Tongues were as buſie as their Pens in Railing at him, becauſe he was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved to endeavour his utmoſt, that <hi>Epiſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacy</hi> might be reſtor'd in <hi>Scotland,</hi> as it was in <hi>England;</hi> though it had been ſubverted in both Nations, during the <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſurpation</hi> of <hi>Oli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver</hi> the <hi>Tyrant.</hi> 'Twas, this drew upon him the Malice and Revenge of the <hi>Seditious;</hi> and they ſpar'd not in Publick to threaten his <hi>Death.</hi> Nay ſome Years before he was mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd, one of theſe <hi>Furioſo's</hi> ſhot at him in the open Streets of <hi>Edinburgh,</hi> but miſs'd him. Then the <hi>Seditious</hi> publiſh'd <hi>Libels,</hi> wherein they gloried in the Attempt, and were only ſorry that it took not Effect. They alſo Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheſied, that he ſhould die a Violent Death; and it was eaſie for them to preſage this, which they were reſolv'd to execute them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves.</p>
                  <pb n="196" facs="tcp:102965:111"/>
                  <p>Accordingly in the 3d. and 4th. <hi>Moons</hi> of this Year, they were ready to give the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal Blow, but his Watchfulneſs prevented them. However on the 3d. of the <hi>Moon</hi> of <hi>May,</hi> as he was Travelling with his <hi>Eldeſt Daughter</hi> in his Coach, with Two or Three Servants attending him, he was ſet upon at Mid-day by Nine of theſe <hi>Religious Ruffians;</hi> who having firſt wounded his beloved Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, to enhaunce his dying Grief; then hack'd and hew'd him in a Butcherly and Barba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous Manner, till at length they left him Dead on the Spot.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Venerable Cadileſquer,</hi> I pray <hi>God</hi> defend thee from Popular Envy, Malice, and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge; from the Wounds given by the Pens of <hi>Libellers,</hi> and the Tongues of the Spight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful.

                  <p>DOublteſs, there never was any Creature form'd of Fleſh and Blood, comparable to the <hi>Meſſias:</hi> No Mortal like the Son of <hi>Mary,</hi> Jeſus was repleniſh'd with all the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Excellencies and Perfections of the Univerſe.</p>
                  <p>I am not ſo profane or preſumptuous, as to think or ſay any Thing in Contempt of <hi>Mahomot;</hi> though I take the Liberty to Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lebrate the high Praiſes of the WORD in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carnate, the Firſt-Born and moſt Illuſtrious of all Beings, <hi>on this Side the Eternal Father.

                  </p>
                  <p>When the Everlaſting Intellect had, from Indeterminate Ages, lain dreaming on the ſoft and downy Bed of CHAOS, or the <hi>Firſt Matter:</hi> In the Grand Cabin of uncircum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſed Darkneſs, and envelop'd with the ſhady Curtains of Old, Old NIGHT: When he had tumbl'd, toſs'd and rowl'd from ſide to ſide: When he had ſtretch'd his Endleſs Limbs for Eaſe, to ſeek one Corner of the Infinite Expanſe, where he might abate the Sempiternal Heat of Love. At laſt, he fix'd
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:102965:112"/>his Foot upon the cool Idea of this World of ours.</p>
                  <p>Then ſprang the WORD, from the all<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fertile WOMB. The Melancholy ſad <hi>Abyſs</hi> rejoyc'd; for, in the WORD was <hi>Light</hi> and <hi>Life;</hi> which darting through the <hi>Eternal Heap</hi> of <hi>Sluggiſh</hi> and <hi>unactive</hi> MATTER, with Divine <hi>Chymiſtry</hi> firſt drew, an <hi>Extract</hi> of the pureſt Parts, which form'd the <hi>Firma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</hi> Next, roſe the Sun, the Moon and Stars; and then the groſſer Elements, with all their different Productions.</p>
                  <p>Theſe are the Generations of the Univerſe; when God made the Heavens and the Earth, and the Angels ſtarted out of the Grand <hi>Ener<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy,</hi> like <hi>Volatile Spirits</hi> from <hi>Balneo Mariae.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>All things Viſible and Inviſible proceed from the WORD, and the moſt excellent of created Beings owe their Original to HIM that was the only Inſtrument by which the Eternal Architect contriv'd and flam'd this vaſt Machine, ſo Incomprehenſible and Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious.</p>
                  <p>O <hi>Hebatolla!</hi> Who can enough admire this mighty Product of the Eternal MIND? And yet the greateſt and moſt Excellent Theatre of Beings, is hid from Mortal Eyes. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore leaving thoſe high and lofty Speculations, let us deſcend to the WORD Incarnate, or the BREATH of <hi>God</hi> walking and conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing on Earth with Men in the Humble Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſe of Fleſh and Blood. The ſame was the <hi>Meſſias</hi> of the Chriſtians, as the <hi>Alcoran</hi> in ſeveral Places aſſures us. And the Chriſtian
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:102965:112"/>Goſpel of the <hi>Eagle</hi> confirms it, where it ſays, <hi>In the Beginning was the WORD, and the WORD was with God,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>and the WORD became Fleſh, and pitch'd his Tent among us.</hi>

                  <p>Doubtleſs <hi>he was conceived of the Virgin Mary,</hi> by that Smell of a <hi>Roſe</hi> which the Angel <hi>Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>briel</hi> brought to her from <hi>Paradiſe.</hi> For, he was not begot by the Will of Man, or through the Luſt of Concupiſcence; but by a ſudden Infuſion of the Divine Virtue. The <hi>Power of the Omnipotent overſhadow'd,</hi> ſurpriz'd, and raviſh'd the <hi>Holy Maid</hi> in a Tranſport of Joy; ſhe took the <hi>Flower</hi> from the Hand of <hi>Gabriel,</hi> which ſhe had no ſooner ſmelt to, but ſhe was ready to diſſolve and faint away in an Extaſie of Love. But the Angel Che<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh'd her with comfortable Words, and ſhe became reſign'd to the Will of the <hi>All-merci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful</hi> and <hi>Gracious.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>At the End of Nine Months <hi>Jeſus</hi> was Born of her, not after the Manner of other Children. For, as the Book of Myſterious Secrets tells us, <hi>He came forth from between her Breaſts, wrapt up in a Mantle of Aroma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick Roſes.</hi>

                  <p>The Daughters of Paradiſe came down and waited on the <hi>Virgin Mother</hi> at the Hour of her unſpeakable Child-birth.

                  <p>This celebrated Sport of <hi>Baiting</hi> or Cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing the <hi>Bull</hi> is ſo well known to thee, who haſt been an Eye-witneſs of it at <hi>Tunis,</hi> and

                  <p>But to return to the Servile Life which the <hi>Queens</hi> of <hi>Spain</hi> lead; They are obliged to go to <hi>Bed</hi> at a certain preciſe Stroke of the Clock every Night, with this only Diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence, <hi>That it is an Hour later in Summer than in Winter.</hi> Beſides <hi>Her,</hi> there is no other Married Woman ſuffer'd to lie in the <hi>King</hi>'s Palace; ſo that the <hi>Queen</hi> is attended only by <hi>Virgins</hi> or <hi>Widows.</hi> Neither can <hi>She</hi> her ſelf ever Marry again after the <hi>King</hi>'s Death.

Judge now, <hi>Magnificent Vizir,</hi> whether it be not a deſirable Thing for a <hi>French Princeſs</hi> to be made <hi>Queen</hi> of <hi>Spain?</hi> A <hi>Princeſs</hi> bred up in a <hi>Court</hi> abounding with all ſorts of <hi>Gentileſſes, Gallantines,</hi> and <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightful Liberties;</hi> muſt needs think her ſelf in a Monaſtery or ſome worſe Place of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finement, after ſhe has been but a Day or Two in the Court of <hi>Spain.</hi> But Reaſons of State ſuperſede all theſe Inconveniences. 'Tis
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:102965:118"/>the peculiar Unhappineſs of the Princes here in the <hi>West,</hi> that they Marry for Intereſt more than for Love.</p>
                  <p>There is another Match going forward be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the <hi>Dauphine</hi> of <hi>France,</hi> and the <hi>Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs Ann Marie Victoire, Siſter to the Duke of Bavaria.</hi> Theſe <hi>Infidels</hi> are Uniting their ſcatter'd Strengths and Intereſts.

                     <hi>To the</hi> Venerable Mufti.</head>
                  <p>THat I may give thee a clearer <hi>Idea</hi> of <hi>Rome</hi>'s Original, it is neceſſary to ſtep farther Backward in Antiquity; and caſt our Eyes on the Ruins of <hi>Troy,</hi> ſet on Fire by the <hi>Greeks,</hi> and laid in Aſhes, after a War of Ten Years, to Revenge the Rape of <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lena,</hi> Wife to <hi>Menelaus,</hi> whom <hi>Paris</hi> the <hi>Tro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jan</hi> Prince and Gueſt to <hi>Menelaus,</hi> carried away with him by Force.</p>
                  <p>From the deplorable Flames of <hi>Troy, An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenor</hi> and <hi>Aeneas</hi> eſcap'd, and got to Sea: The Former being forced by Diſtreſs of Weather on that Part of <hi>Italy</hi> which is now under the Dominion of <hi>Venice,</hi> where he built <hi>Padua:</hi> The Latter came with a Fleet of Two and Twenty Ships to <hi>Latium,</hi> now called <hi>Cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pagna di Roma,</hi> and <hi>St. Peter</hi>'s <hi>Patrimony,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the <hi>Eſtate</hi> of the <hi>Church.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>At that Time <hi>Latinus</hi> the Son of <hi>Faunus,</hi> or as ſome ſay, of <hi>Hercules,</hi> Reign'd in <hi>Lati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um,</hi> before whom there had been but Four <hi>Kings</hi> in the <hi>Country.</hi> Thoſe were <hi>Janus, Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turnus, Picus,</hi> and <hi>Faunus.</hi> Whilſt <hi>Janus</hi> Reign'd, <hi>Saturn</hi> being expell'd by his Son <hi>Jupiter,</hi> fled to <hi>Italy;</hi> where being Hoſpita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly receiv'd, he built a <hi>Caſtle,</hi> calling it after his own Name <hi>Saturnia.</hi> At length he ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:102965:119"/>the Kingdom of <hi>Latium;</hi> which he left to his Son <hi>Picus,</hi> and he to <hi>Faunus.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>In his Time <hi>Evander</hi> ſailed out of <hi>Arcadia,</hi> and came to <hi>Italy,</hi> Sixty Years before the Deſtruction of <hi>Troy.</hi> He built a Town cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>Pallantium,</hi> where afterwards <hi>Rome</hi> was built. Much about the ſame Time, the <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lagians</hi> went out of <hi>Theſſaly</hi> into <hi>Epirus</hi> and <hi>Dodona</hi> firſt; and then paſſing over into <hi>Italy,</hi> join'd themſelves with the <hi>Aboriginal Arcadi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans;</hi> who were got thither before them. Theſe united their Forces, and expell'd the <hi>Sicilians</hi> from the <hi>Country:</hi> Who paſſing o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver to <hi>Trinacria,</hi> or the <hi>Iſland</hi> of <hi>Three capes,</hi> gave to it the Name of <hi>Sicilia,</hi> which it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains to this Day. When <hi>Evander</hi> had been Five Years in <hi>Italy, Hercules,</hi> with a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany of <hi>Greeks,</hi> Landing on the ſame Shore, was kindly entertained by him.</p>
                  <p>At length the <hi>Kingdom</hi> of <hi>Latium</hi> fell to <hi>Latinus,</hi> in whoſe <hi>Reign Aeneas</hi> came thither; and having enter'd into a League with <hi>Lati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus,</hi> marry'd his Daughter <hi>Lavinia:</hi> From whoſe Name he called a <hi>Town</hi> which he built in thoſe parts, <hi>Lavinium.</hi> Then <hi>Turnus</hi> King of the <hi>Rutuli,</hi> being angry that <hi>Latinus</hi> had given his Daughter to a Stranger rather than to him, who was a Native, and to whom ſhe was before berroth'd, invaded his Country. But the <hi>Rutuli</hi> were overcome in Battel, and both <hi>Turnus</hi> and <hi>Latinus</hi> loſt their Lives: So that the <hi>Kingdom</hi> fell to <hi>Aeneas.</hi> But he en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy'd it not long: For the <hi>Rutuli,</hi> at Three Years End came againſt him under the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct
<pb n="214" facs="tcp:102965:120"/>of <hi>Mezentius, King</hi> of the <hi>Tyrrhenians,</hi> now call'd <hi>Toſcans.</hi> And <hi>Aeneas</hi> being kill'd in the Battel, his Son <hi>Aſcanius</hi> took poſſeſſion of the <hi>Kingdom.</hi> He having made <hi>Peace</hi> with <hi>Mecentius,</hi> and quell'd the Reſt of his Enemies; built a <hi>City</hi> which he call'd <hi>Long Alba,</hi> the 30th. Year from the Building of <hi>Lavinium.</hi> In this <hi>City</hi> of <hi>Long Alba,</hi> there Reign'd after <hi>Aſcanius</hi> Fourteen <hi>Kings,</hi> even to the Time of <hi>Romulus,</hi> and the Foundations of <hi>Rome.</hi> The Fourteenth of theſe <hi>Kings</hi> was <hi>Amulius,</hi> who over-reach'd his Brother <hi>Numitor,</hi> to whom the <hi>Kingdom</hi> belong'd by Right of <hi>Primogeniture.</hi> And to be ſecure of all Things, he made <hi>Sylvia,</hi> the only Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of <hi>Numitor,</hi> a <hi>Veſtal;</hi> that he might have no Fear of <hi>Numitor's</hi> Poſterity. Yet <hi>Sylvia</hi> was got with Child by Some-body, and brought forth <hi>Twins,</hi> who were called <hi>Romu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lus</hi> and <hi>Remus.</hi> Theſe were expos'd to the wide World by the Command of <hi>King Amu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lius;</hi> and were privately Nouriſh'd by <hi>Fau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtulus,</hi> till they came of Years. Then being inform'd of their Birth and Extraction, with the true State of Things, they ſlew <hi>Amulius,</hi> and reſtor'd their Grandfather <hi>Numitor</hi> to his <hi>Kingdom.</hi> In the Second Year or whoſe <hi>Reign, Romulus</hi> built the <hi>City</hi> of <hi>Rome.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>In the Eighteenth Year of his Age, <hi>Romu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lus</hi> was ſaluted <hi>King,</hi> when he had kill'd his Brother <hi>Remus</hi> for leaping in Contempt over the <hi>Ditch</hi> he had made round the <hi>City.</hi> Thus he Conſecrated the Fortifications of the <hi>City</hi> with his own <hi>Blood,</hi> But all this while <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mulus</hi>
                     <pb n="215" facs="tcp:102965:120"/>had Built but the Shadow of a City, ſince there were no Inhabitants to People and Defend it. However, he quickly pitch'd up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on a Method to ſupply this Defect. There was a <hi>Grove</hi> hard by, which he made a <hi>San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctuary</hi> for all Perſons in Diſtreſs, and who were willing to make their Fortunes upon Hazard. This was proclaim'd in the Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring Regions: And an Innumerable Mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude of Criminals, Debtors and Malecon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tents flock'd thirher from all Parts; beſides Shepherds and other Perſons, who only through a Natural Inconſtancy ſought a Change of Life. So that there was a <hi>Gallimaufry</hi> of <hi>Trojans</hi> who came over with <hi>Aeneas;</hi> of <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cadians</hi> who follow'd <hi>Evander;</hi> and of ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral other Nations; beſides the Natives of <hi>Toſcany</hi> and <hi>Latium.</hi> Out of theſe, as out of ſo many <hi>Elements, Romulus</hi> extracted the <hi>Body</hi> of a <hi>Commonwealth.</hi> But he confider'd with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al, that this New <hi>Republick</hi> could not ſubſiſt beyond the Age and Lives of thoſe Men who form'd it; They being without Hopes of Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterity, as having no Women among them To provide for this Inconvenience, they treated with the Bordering People about Marriages: Which being denied them, they had Recourſe to Stratagems and Violence. They invited the <hi>Sabines</hi> and other Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours, to come and ſee ſome <hi>Plays</hi> which they promis'd to exhibit in Honour of <hi>Nep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Bait took; and Multitudes of both Sexes, eſpecially the Younger Sort, throng'd
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:102965:121"/>thither to be Spectators of the <hi>Roman</hi> Novel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties. When on a ſudden a certain Signal be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing given, the <hi>Romans</hi> leap'd from their Places, and ruſhing among the Strangers, every Man ſeiz'd the Female that beſt pleas'd him, or that firſt came to Hand, and made her his Wife.</p>
                  <p>This was the Cauſe of ſpeedy Wars: End the Neighbouring People, who had been thus robb'd of their Women, took up Arms to revenge the Injury. But they were <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>outed, put to Flight, and one of their Towns laid? Waſte. The <hi>Romans</hi> alſo took Rich Spo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>s from them, which they Conſecrated to their <hi>Gods.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>In the mean Time, the City of <hi>Rome</hi> was deliver'd into the Hands of the <hi>Sabines,</hi> by <hi>Tarpeia</hi> a Virgin: Who, as ſome ſay, was corrupted with Gold by <hi>Tatius,</hi> the <hi>Captain</hi> of the <hi>Sabines:</hi> Whilſt others affirm. That ſhe did it innocently, and with a Deſign to ſave the City, inſtead of betraying it. For ſhe ask'd as a Reward of her ſuppos'd Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, the Shields of the <hi>Sabines;</hi> thinking that being thus in part diſarm'd, they might eaſily be overcome by the <hi>Romans.</hi> But they ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible of her Stratagem, promis'd what ſhe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded; and performed it accordingly; but in ſuch a manner, as plainly diſcover'd their Revenge of an Injury, rather than their Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude for a Kindneſs: For they threw their Sheilds ſo thick upon her, that they preſs'd her to Death.</p>
                  <pb n="217" facs="tcp:102965:121"/>
                  <p>Then entring the City Pell-mell, there com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menc'd a Furious Battle between the <hi>Romans</hi> and the <hi>Sabines.</hi> The Streets flowed with Blood, till the Wives of the <hi>Romans,</hi> for whoſe Sake this War began, came tearing their Hair; and running between the Two Armies, at length brought them to a Truce, and Agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. Then a Solemn League was made be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween <hi>Romulus</hi> and <hi>Tatius.</hi> And, what is more Wonderful; the <hi>Sabines,</hi> leaving their Native Seats, came, with all their Wealth, to live in <hi>Rome;</hi> communicating Part of their Riches to their Sons-in-Law, by Way of Dowry.</p>
                  <p>The Forces of the <hi>Romans</hi> being thus in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creas'd, by the Acceſſion of the <hi>Sabines, Romu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lus</hi> applied himſelf to the Publick Adminiſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, with all Care and Policy. He appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Youth to be always in Arms, on Horſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>back; that they might be conſtantly upon their Guard, and ready equipp'd againſt the Surprizes of War: That the <hi>Chief Council</hi> of the <hi>Commonwealth</hi> ſhould conſiſt of the <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niors;</hi> who were called <hi>Fathers</hi> for their <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority,</hi> and <hi>Senators</hi> for their <hi>Age.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Affairs being thus diſpos'd, One Day, when there was a Full <hi>Senate, Romulus</hi> being pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, was on a ſudden taken from their Sight. Some think he was Murder'd by Conſpiracy, and cut into Small Pieces by the <hi>Senators:</hi> Others ſay, he was Poyſon'd. But the Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Report was, that he was <hi>Deified. Julius Proculus</hi> was the Author of this; who taking Notice that there aroſe a Violent Tempeſt at the ſame Inſtant that <hi>Romulus</hi> diſappear'd, and
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:102965:122"/>that the Sun was juſt then Eclips'd, inſinuated to the People, that <hi>Romulus</hi> was become a <hi>God.</hi> Nay, he took an Oath, That he ſaw him in a much more Auguſt Form, than whilſt he was a <hi>Mortal:</hi> And that <hi>Romulus</hi> commanded them to Adore him for a <hi>God;</hi> affirming, that he was called <hi>Quirinus</hi> in <hi>Heaven;</hi> and aſſuring them, that <hi>Rome</hi> ſhould conquer the <hi>Whole Earth.</hi>

                  <p>
                     <hi>Numa Pompilius</hi> ſucceeded <hi>Romulus,</hi> being invited to the <hi>Kingdom</hi> by the <hi>Romans,</hi> who had a Veneration for him on the Bare Fame of his <hi>Sanctity</hi> and <hi>Religion.</hi> He raught them <hi>Holy Rites</hi> and <hi>Ceremonies,</hi> with whatſoever pertain'd to the Worſhip of the Immortal <hi>Gods.</hi> He divided the Year into Twelve Months, and appointed the <hi>Holy-Days.</hi> He ordain'd the <hi>Pontifs, Augurs, Salii,</hi> with other Ranks of <hi>Prieſts.</hi> He gave them the <hi>Ancilia</hi> and <hi>Palla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dium,</hi> which came down from <hi>Heaven:</hi> And he inſtituted the <hi>Veſtal Fire.</hi> In a Word, He perſuaded them, that whatſoever he taught them, he receiv'd from the Goddeſs <hi>Aegeria.</hi> And this wrought ſo Efficaciouſly on the Minds of the Rude and Ignorant People, that they came, at Length, to Govern that <hi>Empire</hi> with <hi>Juſtice</hi> and <hi>Religion,</hi> which they got by <hi>Robbery</hi> and <hi>Oppreſſion.</hi>

                  <p>THY Laſt Letter appears Magiſterial and Peremptory, like a Summons from the <hi>Inquiſition.</hi> Thou requireſt an Account of my <hi>Faith,</hi> and what <hi>Idea</hi> I have of <hi>Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion;</hi> ſuſpecting that I am inclin'd to <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſie.</hi> This proceeds from the Freedom I formerly took, in Diſcourſing againſt the <hi>Pope's Infallibility,</hi> the Newly Canoniz'd <hi>Saints,</hi> and the <hi>Doctrine</hi> of <hi>No Salvation out of the Roman Church.</hi> I ſee, thy Zeal makes thee Peeviſh, and Moroſe. Indeed, it is a Grace that ſoon turns ſowr, if it be not kept in a Clean Heart, and a Temperate Air, free from the Vapours of <hi>Superſtition.</hi> How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, I am willing to ſatisfie thy Demand, as well as I can; and tranſmit My Soul to thee in <hi>Effigie.</hi>

                  <p>Tho' we cannot Pourtray Negatives, yet every Picture has its Back-ſide, whereon the Cunning <hi>Painter</hi> may draw the Reverſe of his Firſt Deſign; or, at leaſt, the Spectator's Imagination may ſupply the <hi>Painter</hi>'s Office, and form <hi>Idea</hi>'s quite contrary to the Origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Piece. That thou may'ſt therefore the better comprehend what I am, in Point of <hi>Religion</hi> and <hi>Faith,</hi> I will firſt repreſent what I am not.</p>
                  <pb n="220" facs="tcp:102965:123"/>
                  <p>Conceive then, that I am no Narrow-Soul'd <hi>Jew,</hi> who confines <hi>Salvation</hi> to the <hi>Lineage</hi> of <hi>Jacob;</hi> and lays an Hereditary Claim to <hi>Heaven,</hi> becauſe, for the Wickedneſs of his Execrable Race, he is not allow'd to poſſeſs a Foot of Land on Earth: Who, to ſtrength<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en his Title, produces the Scheme of his <hi>Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nealogy;</hi> proving that he deſcended, in a <hi>Right Line,</hi> from one of thoſe <hi>Parricides,</hi> who mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd the <hi>Meſſias:</hi> And, for that Reaſon, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouches, that <hi>Paradiſe</hi> is entail'd to him; a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the reſt of his Brethren, on the Score of his <hi>Fore-fathers</hi> Merit.</p>
                  <p>Neither am I a <hi>Chriſtian</hi>-Hypocrite, who mocks himſelf, and All that ſee him, with his Empty Formalities: Who conſtantly calls upon <hi>Jeſus</hi> every Morning, to ſanctifie his Reſolution of Sinning againſt <hi>God</hi> before Night. Who tires out the Patience of the <hi>Saints</hi> and <hi>Angels,</hi> with the <hi>Crambe</hi> of his Vain Repetitions. His <hi>Ave Maria's, Ora pro Nobis's,</hi> and the reſt of his Religious <hi>Jargon.</hi> Who goes to <hi>Church,</hi> that he may get the Whip-hand of the <hi>Devil;</hi> and, meeting him on <hi>Holy Ground,</hi> may whiſper <hi>Treaſon</hi> againſt <hi>God Almighty,</hi> over his <hi>Beads,</hi> or his <hi>Prayer-Book;</hi> as the <hi>Germans</hi> do againſt the <hi>Emperor,</hi> over their <hi>Bottles, ſub Roſa,</hi> without any <hi>Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervators,</hi> or <hi>Tell-tales.</hi>

                  <p>I am no Worſhipper of Images, Pictures, Old, Rotten, Worm-eaten Bits of Wood, or other Pretended Relicks of <hi>Christ,</hi> and his <hi>Saints.</hi> I cannot be perſuaded, that <hi>God</hi> is well pleas'd to ſee me make a Fool of my ſelf,
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:102965:123"/>and Trot up and down in <hi>Pilgrimage,</hi> to Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour Five or Six Sham-Heads of St. <hi>John</hi> the <hi>Baptist;</hi> for, in ſo many ſeveral Places do they pretend to ſhew that one <hi>Sacred Relick,</hi> which cannot be Multiplied. Neither can I believe the Miraculous Vegetation, and Conſtant Growth of the <hi>Croſs;</hi> which they pretend to ſhew Whole and Entire at <hi>Caeſarea,</hi> whilſt it is exhibited alſo in Millions of Pieces, through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out <hi>Chriſtendom.</hi> So that there is ſcarce a <hi>Chriſtian Gentleman</hi> of any Quality, in <hi>Europe, Aſia, Africa,</hi> or <hi>America,</hi> who does not boaſt his Share of this Wonderful <hi>Relick.</hi> If all which Pieces were put together, they would, probably, make a Thouſand ſuch <hi>Croſſes,</hi> as that which is kept in <hi>Paleſtine,</hi> for the ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed True <hi>Croſs</hi> whereon <hi>Jeſus</hi> ſuffer'd <hi>Death;</hi> and yet, they are all ſaid to be cut off from That. Indeed, <hi>Father William,</hi> I have no Great Stomach to ſwallow down theſe Great Wooden <hi>Fables:</hi> The very Chips are enough to choak me. But then comes the <hi>Milk</hi> of the <hi>Bleſſed Virgin</hi> to my Relief, with which I may rinſe my Unbelieving Throat, almoſt in every <hi>Pariſh,</hi> or <hi>Monaſtick Church,</hi> I come at. For, I dare ſay, there's more of this to be found in ſuch Places, than an <hi>Hungarian</hi> Cow would give in Seven Years together. But it Curdles in my Stomach, and makes me Sick. The very <hi>Idea</hi> of theſe Child-Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurdities, is as Operative as the Draught of an <hi>Antimonial-Cup.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>It would be too tedious to turn up all the Negative Side of my Religion; and explain,
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:102965:124"/>in an Hundred more Particulars, what I am not: Let us now therefore reverſe the <hi>Tablet,</hi> and ſee what I poſitively am.</p>
                  <p>And here I am at a Loſs for a Compendi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Title, or Name, to give my ſelf, ſaving that of a <hi>Chriſtian:</hi> For, I know not to what more Particular <hi>Predicament</hi> I belong. As for the Diſtinguiſhing Characteriſticks of <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pist, Proteſtant, Lutheran, Calvinist, Socinian, &amp;c.</hi> I eſteem 'em no otherwiſe, than the Brands of ſo many Religious Factions in the <hi>Church.</hi> And the Particular Title of <hi>Roman-Catholick,</hi> looks like a <hi>Soloeciſm</hi> in Common Senſe. I would therefore be taken for a <hi>Chriſtian,</hi> who neither makes Parties, nor ſides with any. But, honouring <hi>Jeſus</hi> as our Common Lord and Maſter, I endeavour to obey his Laws peaceably, and like a Loyal Subject.</p>
                  <p>I lay for a Foundation of all my Practice toward Men, this Golden Rule, which He gave us; <hi>Not to do that to Another, which I would not have done to my Self.</hi> Upon this <hi>Baſis</hi> is built the whole Fabrick of Human Juſtice. I endeavour to regulate my own Paſſions, and to bear with thoſe of Others: To be angry with my ſelf, for the leaſt <hi>Pec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cadillo;</hi> but to frame Excuſes for the Errors and Offences which my Neighbour commits. Here riſes the Superſtructure of all Vertues, ſupported by <hi>Patience, Hope,</hi> and <hi>Faith;</hi> ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented by <hi>Charity, Meekneſs,</hi> and <hi>Temper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance;</hi> and adorn'd all over with <hi>Good Works.</hi>

                  <p>THey are extremely Merry here in <hi>Paris,</hi> Nothing but Dancing, Singing, Roar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, Drinking, Ringing of Bells, making of Bonfires, and other Illuminations, Shooting of Guns, Flirting about Squibs, Crackers, Serpents, Rockets, and all manner of Gun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>powder Compoſitions. If it ſhould hold but Two Hours longer, I believe they wou'd be in Danger of running all Mad. This is the Hour of Mid-night, and yet they are in the Height of their Jollity, which is not cuſtomary in theſe <hi>Weſtern Parts,</hi> tho no Wonder in the <hi>East.</hi> I wiſh there were an Army of <hi>Otto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans</hi> near us; I'd give 'em the Signal, and ſhew them the Way, when and how to enter the Town, and take Poſſeſſion of the Richeſt City in <hi>France:</hi> For they ſuſpect Nothing, and the very <hi>Guards</hi> themſelves are all drunk. 'Twere an eaſie Thing to Surprize 'em, and take 'em Napping. But there is a Time and a Chance for all Things under the <hi>Moon:</hi> And this is their lucky Seaſon.</p>
                  <p>Would'ſt thou know the Occaſion of all this Joy and Security? 'Tis double; Of one Side the News comes rowling from <hi>Spain</hi> of the <hi>New Queen</hi> found there; and on the other Hand, they are tranſported with the
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:102965:125"/>Marriage of <hi>Monſeigneur, the Dauphine of France,</hi> with the <hi>Princeſs Ann Marie Victoire,</hi> Siſter to the <hi>Duke</hi> of <hi>Bavaria.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I mention'd the Advances were made in Order to this <hi>Match,</hi> the latter End of the foregoing Year. The ſame was compleated in all its Ceremonies on this very Day.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>French King</hi> parted from <hi>Verſailles</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the beginning of this <hi>Moon,</hi> with the <hi>Dauphin, his Son,</hi> to meet the <hi>Princeſs.</hi> Their firſt Interview was at a Place called <hi>Vitry.</hi> As ſoon as the <hi>Dauphineſs</hi> (for ſo we muſt call her now) ſaw the <hi>King</hi> alight from his Horſe, ſhe leap'd out of her Coach, and threw her ſelf upon her Knees. But he ſoon rais'd and embrac'd her with <hi>Royal Careſſes,</hi> expreſſing the mighty Joy he felt at this firſt Sight of her, on whom reſted the Hopes of <hi>France,</hi> for Heirs to the Crown. Then he preſented the <hi>Dauphin</hi> to <hi>Her,</hi> who alſo was not wanting on his Part to diſcover the Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timents he had for a <hi>Princeſs</hi> of ſo <hi>great Birth, Merits, Wit and Vertue.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The <hi>Queen</hi> did not ſee her <hi>Daughter-in-law</hi> till they came to <hi>Chalons;</hi> and there ſhe ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſſed her with all Tenderneſs imaginable, in outward Appearance. But <hi>God knows</hi> what's in the Hearts of theſe <hi>Royal Souls,</hi> or how long their Friendſhip may laſt.</p>
                  <p>The Ceremony of the <hi>Eſpouſals</hi> was per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed at that Town, Yeſterday, by the <hi>Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinal</hi> of <hi>Bouillon, Grand Almoner of France,</hi> in the <hi>Chapel</hi> of the <hi>Biſhop's Palace:</hi> And to Day, as I have ſaid, he finiſh'd the whole
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:102965:126"/>Buſineſs in the <hi>Temple</hi> of the <hi>Virgin Mary,</hi> the <hi>Chief Cathedral</hi> of this <hi>City;</hi> in the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of the <hi>King</hi> and <hi>Queen,</hi> with divers <hi>Lords</hi> and <hi>Ladies</hi> of the <hi>Court.</hi> There were other <hi>Biſhops</hi> to aſſiſt him, whoſe Titles I have forgot: But I think they were of <hi>Or<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="2 letters">

                  <p>Aſſure thy ſelf, That I cheriſh a profound Reſpect for thee; and that as I never was, ſo I never will be defective or tardy in ſend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thee thy Proportion of <hi>Weſtern Intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence:</hi> For I muſt divide it among the <hi>Baſſa</hi>'s and other <hi>Miniſters</hi> of the <hi>Port.</hi>

                  <p>BY the <hi>Moſch</hi> of <hi>Sultan Jub,</hi> I ſwear, theſe petty <hi>Republicks</hi> of the <hi>Franks</hi> are not worth a <hi>Muſſulman</hi>'s Thought. However, to ſatisfie thy Curious and Inqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitive

                     <hi>Genius,</hi> I will ſay ſomething of each, as briefly and compendiouſly as I can.</p>
                  <p>In my Two laſt, I diſcours'd of the <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Netherlands,</hi> and the <hi>Swiſs Cantons.</hi> Now I will ferry thee, over the <hi>Leman Lake,</hi> and Land thee in <hi>Geneva,</hi> the Mother. Nurſe, and Center of the <hi>Calvinists.</hi> Theſe are a ſort of <hi>Proteſtants,</hi> diſſenting from the Opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of <hi>Luther</hi> and his Aſſociates; who was the Firſt Author of what they call the Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation here in <hi>Europe.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The City of <hi>Geneva</hi> is very <hi>Ancient;</hi> and was not <hi>Young</hi> in the Time of <hi>Julius Caeſar,</hi> as appears by his <hi>Commentaries;</hi> where he makes mention of its being ſeated on the Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver <hi>Rhoſne,</hi> juſt at the Entrance of the <hi>Leman Lake.</hi> It ſtands very pleaſantly, and has a fertile Soil round about it; where <hi>Ceres</hi> ſtrives to out-do <hi>Bacchus</hi> in her Liberalities. For though there be very good Vineyards in theſe Parts, yet not in ſo great Plenty, as to match the Abundance of <hi>Corn, Pulſe, Hay, Oats, Melons,</hi> and all manner of <hi>Herbs</hi> and <hi>Fruits</hi> that the Climate uſually bears.</p>
                  <p>The Air is pure and wholſome; the <hi>Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters</hi> not ſo cold as in <hi>Germany,</hi> nor the <hi>Sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mers</hi> ſo hot as in ſome Parts of <hi>France.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The People are generally Corpulent, Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roſe, Inhoſpitable to Strangers, eſpecially to thoſe of the <hi>Roman Church,</hi> whom they always ſuſpect as Spies. They are very Frugal. Continent, and Sober. And above all Things, they affect a ſingular Gravity in their Carri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age and Garb.</p>
                  <pb n="229" facs="tcp:102965:127"/>
                  <p>As for Riches, they can boaſt but little; and were it not for their. Art in making Silks, and printing Books, of which infinite Quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tities and Numbers are Exported to other Nations, this <hi>Commonwealth</hi> cou'd not ſupport its own Charges.</p>
                  <p>Indeed their Military Strength is conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble for Bigneſs of the Place: the City being fenc'd by Nature, as well as Art, with im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pregnable Fortifications. They keep an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſite Watch on the Walls; and at the Gates: Neither can any Foreigner have En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance or Lodging there, without undergoing a ſevere Scrutiny. They have a Magazine in the City, furniſh'd with all ſorts of Arms, and with every Thing that is neceſſary to ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtain a long Siege. Add to this, the Friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip and Patronage of the <hi>French Kings,</hi> who have for many Years ſhelter'd this little <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>publick</hi> from the Invaſions and Encroachments of the <hi>Dukes</hi> of <hi>Savoy,</hi> who claim a Title to it.</p>
                  <p>There were formerly Three Forts near the Town, in the Poſſeſſion of the <hi>Savoyards,</hi> which much annoy'd the Inhabitants, and threaten'd the Ruin of the City it ſelf with the Shot of great Braſs Ordnance, which were plac'd there for that Purpoſe. But <hi>Henry</hi> IV. of <hi>France</hi> Took it from the <hi>Duke</hi> of <hi>Savoy,</hi> and Demoliſh'd it in the Year 1600. He alſo caus'd another to be pull'd down, which equally endamag'd the Oppoſite ſide of the City. And a Third the Inhabitants themſelves laid Even with the Ground, being aided by the <hi>French.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <pb n="230" facs="tcp:102965:128"/>
                  <p>If thou would'ſt know, by what Title the <hi>Dukes</hi> of <hi>Savoy</hi> pretend a Right to <hi>Geneva;</hi> I'll tell thee in few Words. In former Times, there was a Feud between the <hi>Counts</hi> of <hi>Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neva,</hi> and her <hi>Biſhops,</hi> about the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, each claiming it as his Due. At length a certain <hi>Biſhop</hi> procur'd the Principality of <hi>Geneva,</hi> from <hi>Frederic</hi> I. Emperor of <hi>Germany.</hi> This occaſion'd a Civil War between him and the <hi>Count</hi> of <hi>Geneva,</hi> which laſting many Years, and conſuming the Money and For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of the Town; the Inhabitants, with the Conſent of the <hi>Biſhop,</hi> implor'd the Protecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the <hi>Count</hi> of <hi>Savoy.</hi> He rais'd an Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, and march'd againſt the Count of <hi>Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>va;</hi> taking many Towns and Fortreſſes from him, which belong'd to the <hi>Republick.</hi> Then he advanc'd with the Army near to the Walls of <hi>Geneva,</hi> more like an Enemy than a Friend to the <hi>Biſhop</hi> and People. For not content with his new Conqueſts, he demand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed as much Money as wou'd quit the Char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges he had been at in this Expedition. The <hi>Biſhop</hi> repreſented to him, <q>That he ought to be content with thoſe Places he had won, and that they ſhould be acknowledg'd Feudatories of <hi>Savoy.</hi>
                     </q> But this did not ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfie the greedy <hi>Count,</hi> who threaten'd the City, if they wou'd not reimburſe him with Money. The Inhabitants being poor, and fearing worſe Conſequences, ſhou'd they pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voke this <hi>Prince</hi> too far, at laſt agreed with him, <q>That he ſhou'd poſſeſs as much Rights in the City, as the Counts of <hi>Geneva</hi> had
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:102965:128"/>done before this War begun.</q> And this was done by way of Pledge or Mortgage. The <hi>Savoyard</hi> therefore entring the City with his Forces, oppreſſed the Inhabitants with cruel Tyranny. So that being provok'd to deſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate Courſes, they conſpir'd together, and choſe rather to call back the <hi>Count</hi> of <hi>Geneva</hi> to his Native Poſſeſſion, from which he had been violently caſt out by the Uſurping <hi>Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop,</hi> than to ſubmit to a Foreign Juriſdicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, which began ſo early to afflict them with inſupportable Calamities.</p>
                  <p>But this, inſtead of a Remedy, prov'd an Aggravation of their Misfortunes. For the Count of <hi>Geneva,</hi> coming againſt him of <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voy,</hi> with ſome Forces, was overcome in Bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tel, and ſo <hi>Geneva</hi> was reduc'd to greater Streights than before. For the <hi>Savoyards</hi> en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tring the Houſes of the Citizens, drew the Conſpirators from their lurking Holes, and kill'd them, committing a Thouſand other Inſolencies againſt the Inhabitants. Nor did this ceaſe, till the whole Race of the <hi>Counts</hi> of <hi>Geneva</hi> was quite extinct. Then <hi>Amadeus,</hi> the <hi>Count</hi> of <hi>Savoy,</hi> finding that ſtill the <hi>Biſhop</hi> of <hi>Geneva</hi> gave him as much Trouble as the <hi>Counts</hi> had done before, obtain'd of the <hi>Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror Charles</hi> IV. to be made <hi>Vicar</hi> of the <hi>Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire</hi> in his <hi>Provinces;</hi> thinking by the Great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of this Title and Authority to ſuppreſs, the Power of the <hi>Biſhop.</hi> But the <hi>Eccleſia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtick Prince</hi> ſo ſtrongly oppoſed the <hi>Secular,</hi> That he maintain'd his own Juriſdiction, and the Liberty of the People, till the Time of
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:102965:129"/>
                     <hi>Amadeus</hi> VIII. who was his Succeſſor, and the Firſt who was created <hi>Duke</hi> of <hi>Savoy,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing afterwards Elected to the Papacy, which he enjoy'd by the Name of <hi>Felix.</hi> Before his Aſſumption to this Height of <hi>Eccleſiaſtick</hi> Dignity, he had obtain'd of <hi>Pope Martin,</hi> the Juriſdiction of <hi>Geneva</hi> in Temporal Matters. But he found as much trouble in it, as his Predeceſſors had done before. And ſo have all his Succeſſors, to this very Day. For, though they boaſt of the Title, yet they have no more Authority in the Town than the <hi>King</hi> of <hi>Bantam.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This City is govern'd by a <hi>Syndick</hi> and Twenty Five <hi>Senators,</hi> who meet every Day to conſult about the Affairs of the <hi>Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth,</hi> and to decide all Cauſes, whether Criminal or Civil.</p>
                  <p>It is their Chief Intereſt to hold a good Correſpondence with <hi>France,</hi> without whoſe Protection they would ſuffer many In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juries. Therefore the better ſort, as it were by way of Flattery and Complai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſance, dreſs themſelves after the <hi>French</hi> Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhions, and make uſe of that Language, though imperfectly, in all their Letters, and Converſation. But the <hi>Vernacular</hi> is the ſame with that of <hi>Savoy.</hi>
                  </p>

                  <p>In the firſt Place, therefore, it is neceſſary for thee to know, That about Two Hundred Years paſt, a certain <hi>Fryar,</hi> or <hi>Dewick</hi> in our Style, nam'd <hi>Martin Luther,</hi> being of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended at his <hi>Lord</hi> and <hi>Maſter</hi> the <hi>Pope,</hi> or <hi>Biſhop of Rome,</hi> ſet up for himſelf, as the on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <hi>Preacher, Doctor, Reformer,</hi> and <hi>Apoſtle</hi> of that Age. He drew Abundance of People after him, and not a few <hi>Princes</hi> and <hi>Nobles.</hi> The known ſcandalous Vices of the <hi>Roman Clergy</hi> on one ſide, and the <hi>Epidemical</hi> Incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation which Mortals have for Novelty on the other, facilitated his Innovation. He grew famous in <hi>Wirtemberg, Ausburgh,</hi> and other Parts of <hi>Germany,</hi> where he liv'd. In a Word, his <hi>New Doctrines</hi> were like an <hi>Earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quake</hi> to the whole Empire. He ſtagger'd

The <hi>French</hi> ſay, <hi>The</hi> Engliſh <hi>would as ſoon embrace Mahometaniſm as any other Religion, could ye but once get the length of their Foot.</hi> (This is an <hi>Engliſh Adage.</hi>) 'Tis certain they are a very Mutable, Inconſtant,
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:102965:131"/>Rebellious People. They ſurfeit on the Plenty which Nature has giv'n 'em. Which makes them ſtill uneaſie, diſcontented, and delicate. They ſpew out their own Happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, to eaſe the Stomach of that intemperate Nation, and prepare it for Foreign <hi>Sham-Banquets</hi> of <hi>Magicians.</hi> Of Old they were Brave, and ſtedfaſt to their Principles: Then their Renown was ſpread far and wide. <hi>When a Baronet of</hi> England (as 'tis recorded in the Hiſtories of <hi>France,</hi> which muſt be impartial in this Point) <hi>kill'd Five and Twenty</hi> French<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, <hi>among whom were Two Marquiſes, Four Knights, and Nine Nobles of the Leſſer Order.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But now they have quite loſt their anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent <hi>Fame</hi> and <hi>Valour.</hi> They are corrupted with a thouſand Debaucheries. They are as fickle as the Wind, and as moveable as the Duſt it raiſes in the Streets. In fine, They are nothing at all, but the Obloquy and Scorn of other Nations.</p>
                  <p>But to return to the <hi>French Huguenots,</hi> and <hi>Calvin</hi> their Maſter. I was once acquainted with a very ancient <hi>Dervich</hi> or <hi>Fryar,</hi> when I firſt came to <hi>Paris,</hi> who confidently affirm'd, That he had often heard his own Father ſay, <q>That <hi>Calvin,</hi> in his Preſence, once thruſt his Right-Hand into the Fire, wiſhing it had been burn'd to Aſhes when it directed his Pen in writing againſt the Real Preſence of the <hi>Body of Jeſus the Meſſias, in the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crament of the Altar.</hi> But ſince he had writ that fatal Treatiſe, he cou'd do no leſs in Honour than defend it to the laſt.</q> And
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:102965:131"/>yet this is one of the Cardinal and moſt im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portant Points in Controverſie between the <hi>Catholicks</hi> and the <hi>Huguenots;</hi> whereon the whole Body of <hi>Religion</hi> depends, and turns to the Right-Hand or to the Left. So that in the main, the <hi>Huguenots</hi> have no other Ground for their Separation from the <hi>Roman Church,</hi> than the confeſs'd Obſtinacy of their Ringleader. And I tell thee plainly, they are the Diſciples of his Humour, as well as of his Doctrins. There is not ſuch a pertinaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous ſort of People living; ſo ſingular, partial, ſelf conceited, wilful and incorrigible. We muſt always except out of this Character, ſome of the <hi>Gentry,</hi> moſt of the <hi>Nobles,</hi> and all the <hi>Beaux Eſprits</hi> of that <hi>Profeſſion,</hi> as they call 'em; that is, the Men of Senſe. For, they deſpiſe the <hi>Bigotry</hi> of their Brethren, and go to their <hi>Publick Aſſemblies,</hi> rather in Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaiſance to their Parents, Friends, and Kin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred, or for the ſake of Intereſt, than out of any real Regards for a Religion of ſo <hi>young a Date,</hi> ſo mean and contemptible a Figure, and which is ſhut up within ſuch narrow Limits.</p>
                  <p>They are, in ſhort, ſo bad, or at leaſt grown ſo odious at the Court, That the <hi>King</hi> is quite Angry with 'em, and reſolved to extirpate them and their <hi>New-fangl'd He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſie,</hi> out of the Nation. In order to this, he proceeds gradually, like a <hi>Politician;</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing not willing to tempt them to a general <hi>Revolt,</hi> by provoking the whole Party at once, and rendring 'em deſperate. No, no, he's cunninger than to draw a <hi>Civil War</hi> up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:102965:132"/>himſelf and his Kingdom, by giving ſo loud an <hi>Alarm,</hi> to a People who are very Rich, Potent, and whoſe Intereſt is much interwoven with that of the <hi>Catholicks.</hi> I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, to ſpeak modeſtly, they are able to keep <hi>Fifty Thouſand Men</hi> of <hi>Arms</hi> in Pay, as they can contrive the Buſineſs among them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves. Therefore knowing, that though the <hi>Preachers</hi> all profeſs the ſame <hi>Religion,</hi> yet every one is not ſo zealous as another in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fending and propagating it; he has made ſuch a Politick Decree, as only touches thoſe particular <hi>Mollahs</hi> (or Miniſters as they call them here) who are convicted of Proſely<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting any <hi>Catholick</hi> to their Hereſie. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by alſo is threaten'd to the Catholicks them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves who ſhall forſake the <hi>Religion</hi> of their Fathers; perpetual Baniſhment, the Loſs of their <hi>Right Hand,</hi> which was lifted up in their Abjuration, and other grievous Penalties.</p>
                  <p>In the mean Time, the <hi>Biſhops</hi> and infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour <hi>Prieſts</hi> are very induſtrious to confirm the <hi>Catholicks</hi> in their Native Faith and Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience, and to Convert the <hi>Huguenots</hi> from their ſuppoſed Errors. I call them ſuppoſed Errors, becauſe it is much one to us that are <hi>Muſſulmans</hi> and Followers of <hi>Mahomet,</hi> whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther one Party of the <hi>Nazarenes,</hi> be in the right of it, or t'other. Only we muſt regard the Intereſt of the <hi>Ottoman Empire.</hi> They are all equally Hereticks and Infidels, ſo long as they are Enemies to the <hi>Meſſenger of God,</hi> the Seal of the Prophets.</p>
                  <pb n="239" facs="tcp:102965:132"/>
                  <p>He that is the moſt Vigorous, and takes the greateſt Pains in Converting the <hi>Hugue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nots,</hi> is the <hi>Biſhop</hi> of <hi>Meaux;</hi> a <hi>Man</hi> of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digious <hi>Eloquence, Senſe,</hi> and <hi>Wit.</hi> This Age does not afford his Equal, in the Perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions of the <hi>Mind</hi> and <hi>Intellect:</hi> He is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foundly Learned, a Man of Univerſal Read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, skilful in moſt Languages: an Oracle in <hi>Philoſophy, Aſtronomy,</hi> and the other <hi>Sciences</hi> of Nature.

                  </p>
                  <p>'Tis true, he is very zealous for the <hi>Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity and infallible Veracity</hi> of the <hi>Roman Church.</hi> But, he aſſerts theſe Things with ſo much <hi>Grace</hi> and <hi>Moderation;</hi> with ſuch a <hi>Maſcu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>line Reaſon,</hi> and with all the Symptoms of a <hi>Sincere Piety;</hi> That I who regard no one <hi>Sect</hi> of the <hi>Franks</hi> more than another, cannot but admire the Natural Abilities and Perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions of his <hi>Soul.</hi> He's <hi>Learned</hi> as <hi>Abdel Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lec, Muli Omar</hi> at <hi>Fez; Pious,</hi> as <hi>Hebatolla Mir Argun,</hi> at <hi>Cogni</hi> in <hi>Natolia; Abſtinent,</hi> as <hi>Mohammed,</hi> in <hi>Arabia; Holy,</hi> as the ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtracted <hi>Mirmadoline, Santone</hi> of the <hi>Vale</hi> of <hi>Sidon.</hi> A Man every Ways accompliſh'd, and inſpir'd with <hi>Divine Munificences.</hi>

                  <head>LETTER III.</head>
                  <head>
                     <hi>To the Venerable</hi> Mufti.</head>
                  <p>SO long as thou doſt not complain of my too frequent Letters, I ſhall not murmur at the Pains of writing them. 'Tis a Pleaſure thus to revolve the <hi>Hiſtories</hi> of paſt Ages. And whilſt I with my own Hand conſign them to Paper, they adhere the faſter to my Memory. I ſhou'd not be ſorry, if I were to ſpend the Remainder of my Days in Epito<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mizing all the Authentick <hi>Records</hi> and <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moirs</hi> that are extant in the World. Such an Exerciſe would be a conſtant Relief of Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancholy by lighting Abundance of <hi>Flambeaux</hi> and <hi>Lamps</hi> in the Soul, to diſperſe the Miſts and Darkneſs which naturally make it ſad. I ended my laſt Letter with the <hi>Reign</hi> of <hi>Nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ma Pompilius</hi> over the <hi>Romans.</hi> Who, as if he had made the Kingdom Hereditary only to Men of Virtue, was no ſooner dead, but the People elected <hi>Tullus Hoſtilius</hi> for their King; in Conſideration of his excellent En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowments and Merits.</p>
                  <p>He inſtructed the <hi>Romans</hi> in a more per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect Military Diſcipline, and improv'd the Art of War. So that having train'd up the Youth to a wonderful Promptneſs and Skill in Arms, he ventur'd to ſend a Defiance to the <hi>Albans,</hi> and invade their Territories, the
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:102965:133"/>they were a ſtout People, and who had Lorded it a long Time in <hi>Italy.</hi> But, when many Battels had been Fought between them, with equal Damage to both ſides; at length to put an End to the War, and make the Loſſes of the Vanquiſhed more Compendious, they mutually agreed to decide the Victory by a Combat of Three Brothers on one ſide, againſt as many on the other. Thoſe on the <hi>Roman</hi> part were call'd, <hi>Horatii;</hi> the <hi>Alban</hi> Brothers <hi>Curiatii.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Fight was Fair and Dubious, and had an Admirable Event: For all the Three <hi>Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riatii</hi> were Wounded, and Two of the <hi>Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ratii</hi> Killed. So that it ſeemed difficult to determine which had the Advantage; One ſound and untouch'd <hi>Roman,</hi> or Three faint and weaken'd <hi>Albans:</hi> However, the ſurvi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving <hi>Horatius</hi> not preſuming too much on his own Strength againſt ſuch an Unequal Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of Enemies, added Policy to his Cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage, and made uſe of this Stratagem:</p>
                  <p>He counterfeited a Flight, that ſo he might ſeparate his Adverſaries, and Engage with them Singly, one after another, according as they overtook him. His Plot took, and he Vanquiſh'd all Three. But he ſullied his Victory with the Blood of his Siſter; whom at his return he killed, becauſe ſhe met him not with Joy and Triumph, but with Grief and Tears for the Loſs of her Spouſe, who was one of the Three <hi>Alban</hi>-Brethren. He was call'd in queſtion for the Bloody Fact: But his Merit ſuperſeded his Crime; and the
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:102965:134"/>Fact which would at another time have coſt him his Head, now ſerved but to Augment his Glory.</p>
                  <p>Not long after this, there broke out a War between the <hi>Romans</hi> and the <hi>Fidenates,</hi> a Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of <hi>Latium,</hi> or <hi>Toſcany.</hi> The <hi>Albans,</hi> ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to their late <hi>League,</hi> were obliged to Aid the <hi>Romans</hi> in their Wars. Wherefore they ſent Auxiliary Forces, under the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of <hi>Metius Tufetius.</hi> But this Captain prov'd Treacherous: For, juſt as the Two Armies were going to enter into Battel, he withdrew his <hi>Albans</hi> to the Top of an Hill; where they ſtood <hi>Neuters,</hi> to behold the For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune of the Fight, that ſo they might joyn the Strongeſt Party. Which, when <hi>Tullus</hi> per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd, he politiokly cried out, with a Loud Voice, in the Hearing of both Armies, <hi>That</hi> Metius <hi>had done this by his Command.</hi> Then the <hi>Romans</hi> took Courage; and their Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies being ſtruck with Terrour, were ſoon Routed, and Overcome. After which, the <hi>Roman King</hi> cauſed the Traytor <hi>Metius Tufe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius</hi> to be tied with Cords to Two Chariots, and torn in Pieces by Wild Horſes. He alſo ruin'd, and quite demoliſh'd <hi>Alba;</hi> not look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on that City now, as the <hi>Parent,</hi> but the <hi>Rival</hi> of <hi>Rome.</hi> However, he firſt tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported to <hi>Rome</hi> all the Riches of <hi>Alba,</hi> with the Inhabitants; that ſo that City might not ſeem to periſh, but only to remove its Situa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and be Incorporated with <hi>Rome.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Ancus Marcius</hi> ſucceeded <hi>Tullus Hoſtilius,</hi> being the Grandchild of <hi>Numa,</hi> by his Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.
<pb n="243" facs="tcp:102965:134"/>He inherited his Qualities alſo as well as his Blood. He encompaſs'd the City with Walls, and joyn'd the Banks of <hi>Tyber,</hi> which ran through the Middle of it, with a Bridge. He likewiſe built the Port <hi>Oſtia,</hi> juſt by the Mouth of the River, where it flows into the Sea; planting there a Colony of <hi>Romans,</hi> as if he had then Preſag'd what afterwards came to paſs; That the Merchandizes of the World ſhould be brought in thither, as in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Maritime Store-houſe of the City de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtin'd to conquer all Things.</p>
                  <p>Him ſucceeded <hi>Tarquinius,</hi> afterwards ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nam'd <hi>Priſcus.</hi> He was of Foreign Extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, yet obtain'd the Sovereignty by his Elegance and Wit. For, being the Son of <hi>Lucumo;</hi> a <hi>Corinthian,</hi> who abandon'd his Country, and fled into <hi>Toſcany,</hi> where he was made <hi>King;</hi> this <hi>Tarquinius,</hi> poliſhing his <hi>Greek</hi> Nature with <hi>Italian</hi> Arts, inſinua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted ſo far with the <hi>Romans,</hi> that they choſe him for their <hi>King.</hi> He augmented the Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of <hi>Senators,</hi> and added Three Hundred Soldiers to the Troops that were already eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſh'd: Which was all he durſt do, in Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard <hi>Attius Navius,</hi> an <hi>Augur,</hi> in High Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt among the <hi>Romans,</hi> had forbid a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny greater Number to be added. Theſe <hi>Augurs</hi> were a ſort of <hi>Diviners,</hi> who fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>told Things to come, from the Chirping, Flying, Feeding, and other Actions of Birds. <hi>Tarquinius,</hi> one Day, ask'd this <hi>Attius Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vius, Whether the Thing could poſſibly be done, which he had then thought upon?</hi> The <hi>Augur</hi>
                     <pb n="244" facs="tcp:102965:135"/>conſulting his Art, anſwer'd, <hi>It might be done.</hi> Then ſaid the <hi>King, I was conſidering, whether I could cut this Whet-ſtone with a Razor. Yes you may;</hi> replied <hi>Attius.</hi> And the <hi>King</hi> did it. From that Time, the College of <hi>Augurs,</hi> firſt Founded by <hi>Romulus,</hi> was had in Sacred Eſteem by the <hi>Romans.</hi> I ſhould have call'd them the <hi>Triumvirate</hi> of <hi>Augurs;</hi> for, there were but Three at firſt, one out of every <hi>Tribe.</hi> But <hi>Servius Tullius,</hi> the next <hi>King,</hi> added a Fourth. Theſe were all <hi>Nobles.</hi> But afterwards, they were increas'd to Nine; and laſt of all, to Fifteen, in the <hi>Dictatorſhip</hi> of <hi>Silla.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>To return to <hi>Tarquinius:</hi> He was no leſs proſperous in War, than in Peace; for he ſubdued Twelve Cities of the <hi>Toſcans,</hi> with the Territories belonging to them. He in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented Robes, and Enſigns of State; the Ivo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry-Seats of Chariots, wherein the <hi>Senators</hi> were carried to the <hi>Council;</hi> the Gold-Rings, and Magnificent Horſe-Trappings, which were given to the <hi>Roman Knights,</hi> as Badges of Honour: Alſo, the Purple and Scarlet-Robes; the Triumphal Chariot of Gold; the Painted <hi>Phrygian</hi> Robe, worn by a Victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious <hi>General,</hi> when he celebrated a Triumph: With many other Ornaments, and Publick Decorations, to ſet forth the Majeſty and Grandeur of the <hi>Roman</hi> State.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Tarquinius</hi> being mortally wounded his Wife <hi>Tanaquil</hi> perſuaded the People, that all was well with him; that his Wounds were not dangerous; that he was only laid in a Slum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber,
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:102965:135"/>and that in a little Time they ſhould fee him Well again: In the Mean while, ſhe ſaid, it was his Will and Pleaſure, that they ſhould obey <hi>Servius Tullius,</hi> a Favourite of hers; who would adminiſter Juſtice, and govern the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple wiſely, during the <hi>King</hi>'s Illneſs.</p>
                  <p>This <hi>Servius Tullius</hi> was the Son of a <hi>Prince</hi> in <hi>Latium;</hi> who being kill'd in a Battel with the <hi>Romans,</hi> his Wife was carried Captive to <hi>Rome;</hi> and being preſented to <hi>Queen Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naquil,</hi> liv'd free from Servitude, under her Protection: And, being with Child, was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver'd of <hi>Servius Tullius,</hi> in <hi>Tanaquil</hi>'s Palace. The <hi>Queen</hi> ſtook a Singular Fancy to the Noble Infant, and gave him Royal Educa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; preſaging, from a Flame which ſhe ſaw environing his Head, that he would be a Famous Man in Time. 'Twas for this Reaſon, ſhe perſuaded the People to receive him as the King's Subſtitute, or Deputy, for a While: Not doubting, but that after they had taſted the Sweetneſs of his Government, and the Death of <hi>Tarquin</hi> ſhould be known, they would eaſily ſubmit to him, as <hi>Tarquin</hi>'s Succeſſor. Her Stratagem had its deſir'd Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect: For, <hi>Servius Tullius</hi> improv'd his Time ſo well in pleaſing the People, that the <hi>King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,</hi> which he obtain'd by Craft, was ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledg'd by all, as due to his Merits and Vertues. He firſt brought the People of <hi>Rome</hi> under an <hi>Aſſeſſment,</hi> whereby every Man's Eſtate was valu'd: He divided them into Claſſes, Wards, and Colleges. And the <hi>Commonwealth</hi> was brought into ſuch Order,
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:102965:136"/>by the Exquiſite Policy of this Wiſe <hi>King,</hi> that the Difference of every Man's Patrimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, Dignity, Age, Trade, and Office, was Regiſter'd in Publick Tables; Which render'd the Oeconomy of this Great State as regular and eaſie, as that of a Private Family, or Houſe.</p>
                  <p>The Laſt of all the <hi>Kings;</hi> was <hi>Tarquinius,</hi> Surnam'd <hi>The Proud,</hi> for the Moroſe and Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dainful Haughtineſs of his Temper. He mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried the Daughter of <hi>Servius Tullius,</hi> in Hopes of Succeeding in the <hi>Kingdom.</hi> But he not ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving Patience to wait for the Natural Death of his <hi>Father-in-Law<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                     </hi> hired Ruffians to Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der him, and then ſeiz'd upon the <hi>Kingdom</hi> by Violence, Neither did he govern the <hi>State</hi> with leſs Wickedneſs and Cruelty, than that by which he obtain'd it: For, he denied Bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial to his Murder'd <hi>Father-in-Law;</hi> Saying, <hi>That he deſerv'd not Better <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſage than</hi> Romu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lus, <hi>who periſh'd without a Sepulchre.</hi> He alſo ſlew the <hi>Chiefs</hi> of the <hi>Nobles,</hi> whom he ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected to be of <hi>Servius</hi>'s Intereſt. And his Wife <hi>Tullia</hi> was as bad as he: For, as ſoon as ſhe had ſaluted her Husband by the Title of <hi>King,</hi> ſhe caus'd her ſelf to be driven in a Chariot, over the Dead Carcaſe of her Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. Both of them exercis'd Great Cruelty, and maſſacred many of the <hi>Senators<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                     </hi> But the Pride of <hi>Tarquin</hi> was intolerable to all. Till, at Length, when he had ſpent enough of his Rage at Home, he turn'd it againſt his Foreign Enemies Abroad; and took many Strong Towns in <hi>Latium.</hi> However, Notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:102965:136"/>all his Vices, he gave the World this Proof of his Piety; That, put of the Spoils which he took from his Enemies, he rais'd Mony, and finiſh'd therewith the Temple of <hi>Jupiter</hi> in the <hi>Capitol,</hi> which his Father, <hi>Tarquinius Priſcus,</hi> had begun. The Story ſays, That, as they were Laying the Foundations of this <hi>Temple,</hi> they found the Head of a Man; which they interpreted as a Good <hi>Omen,</hi> That <hi>Rome</hi> ſhould be the Seat of a Vaſt Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire, and <hi>Miſtreſs</hi> of the whole Earth; as it afterwards came to paſs.</p>
                  <p>The People of <hi>Rome</hi> bore with the Pride of <hi>Tarquin,</hi> but would not bear with the Luſt and Tyranny of his Sons; one of which ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſh'd <hi>Lucretia,</hi> a Woman of Admirable Beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and Vertue. The Chaſte Matron expia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the Diſgrace, by Stabbing her ſelf: And, as ſhe breath'd her Laſt, ſhe charg'd <hi>Brutus</hi> and <hi>Collatinus,</hi> Two Princes, to revenge her Cauſe. Wherefore they ſtir'd up the People to aſſert their Liberty, and abrogate the <hi>King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly</hi> Government: Which was as readily done, as mention'd. And here was an End put to the Tyranny of <hi>Kings.</hi>

                  <head>LETTER IV.</head>
                  <head>
                     <hi>To</hi> Orchan Cabet, Student <hi>in the</hi> Sciences, <hi>and</hi> Penſioner <hi>to the</hi> Sultan.</head>
                  <p>ABout the Soul: That's the Thought I'm upon. That's the World I'm going to write. Whether it ſhall, after the grand Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vorce from the Body, go to Heaven or Hell (as they are commonly repreſented) or whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it ſhall not rather be more happily or miſerably diſpos'd of: Or, if leſs, yet at leaſt in a more proportionate Order of Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Juſtice. Methinks, I taſte and feel the Original Meaning of the Word <hi>Nemeſis.</hi> Which, though it paſs for <hi>Primitive Greek</hi> among the moſt Learned of the <hi>Weſtern</hi> Scholars, yet I can prove it to be a <hi>Phoenici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an Derivative</hi> from the <hi>Chineſe.</hi> And I can demonſtrate likewiſe, That it is full of My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteries.</p>
                  <p>Every Syllable of it, is Sacred and Myſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious, as the <hi>Mrne Mene, Tekel Vpharſin,</hi> of <hi>Beltſchatzar. Numeravit, Numeravit, Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendit, Diviſit.</hi> That's the Senſe of it. So are Words become the Eternal Mind.</p>
                  <p>The very Letters which compoſe Words (I ſhould have ſaid the <hi>Syllables</hi> firſt, in good Manners) are all the Products of the <hi>Mathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maticks;</hi>
                     <pb n="249" facs="tcp:102965:137"/>I mean, of the Original <hi>Science;</hi> not of thoſe paultry <hi>Fragments, Scraps,</hi> and <hi>Offals,</hi> that are taught in <hi>Schools</hi> and <hi>Acade<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies:</hi> Such as the <hi>Elements</hi> of <hi>Euclid,</hi> the <hi>Rudiments</hi> of <hi>Algebra, Benazer, Ki-flud,</hi> or any other Learned <hi>Pen.</hi> There's ſomething more within the Verge of Human Science, than what has been divulg'd hitherto in the <hi>World;</hi> or at leaſt, more than what is now extant, and has eſcap'd the Ruin of Fires, Floods, Earthquakes, and the Jaws of all-de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouring Time.</p>
                  <p>Learned <hi>Orchan,</hi> I will not be prolix: but anſwer me one Queſtion about the Soul. Can'ſt thou believe the Stories of the Prieſt's concerning Purgatory, Hell, and the two other Limbo's? Haſt thou Faith enough to ſwallow the ridiculous Figments of the Book entitled <hi>Speculum Exemplorum;</hi> a Tract ſo highly celebrated and magnified among the Superititious <hi>Nazarenes</hi> of the <hi>Roman</hi> Church? Believe me, theſe Doctrins are the pure Effects of <hi>Anthropomorphiſm,</hi> or the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion of thoſe who repreſent God under the Form of a Mortal Man. For they, poor Souls, are ſo incapable of riſing above this groſs and Earthly Thought, that they even preſume to draw and paint the Effigies of the Eternal Divinity, which has no Figure or Reſemblance. They pourtray him like a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Old Man, with Gray Hairs on his Head and Beard; and then they ſet the Idol up in Temples, to be ador'd. The rude and igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant Vulgar dare not contradict their Guides,
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:102965:138"/>whom they revere as Oracles. They bow before the ſacred Vanity, paying Divine Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours to the Work of Human Art. Thus Superſtition and Error ſpread abroad, and take firm Root in the World. From hence the duller Part of Men derive their Notions of Man's Soul.</p>
                  <p>They cannot conceive how it ſhou'd ſubſiſt after Death, without juſt ſuch a Body of Fleſh and Blood, as it has in this Life: And yet they contradict that very Opinion, by aſſert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, that it cannot have ſuch a Body till the General Reſurrection; whilſt at the ſame time they aſſert, That it ſhall enjoy all the Pleaſures, or ſuffer all the Pains, which none but Corporeal Beings are capable of. Doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs, the <hi>Infidels</hi> are involv'd in a Labyrinth of Hereſies.</p>
                  <p>We <hi>Mortals</hi> know not the State of Depart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Souls; whether they go upwards, or downwards; to the <hi>East</hi> or <hi>West, North</hi> or <hi>South.</hi> We are wholly ignorant of the Cli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mates wherein the <hi>Bleſſed</hi> and the <hi>Damn'd</hi> are ſeparately diſpos'd of. Perhaps the Doctrin of Tranſmigration, taught by <hi>Pythagoras, Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedocles,</hi> and all the <hi>Eaſtern Indians,</hi> may be true: From which Bolief, few<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
                     <hi>Muſſulmans</hi> do diffent. Or it may be, we ſhall, as the Gentile Poets wrote myſteriouſly, fall into <hi>Lethe</hi>'s Lake, into the Region of Forgetful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, where we ſhall be, as though we'd ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver been. This is the Souls unactive State, if any ſuch there be in Nature for an Incor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poreal, Spirit. And then the <hi>Millenaries</hi> or
<pb n="251" facs="tcp:102965:138"/>
                     <hi>Chiliaſts</hi> among the Chriſtians may be much i'th' Right on't, who taught the Sleep of the Soul until the Reſurrection. Indeed, in my Opinion, this Life it ſelf, wherein we think our ſelves ſo much Awake; to Hear, See, Taſte, Smell, Feel, and Revel in the Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures of the Univerſe; is but a Dream or Trance: A grand <hi>Deliquium</hi> of the Soul: The Univerſal Apoplexy of Human Nature. For the true Genuine Life is only to be found <hi>Above,</hi> in the pure Regions of the Air, or more refined Skies: or if not there, at leaſt and loweſt Rate, in the ſuperlative Heights beyond the Stars, remote from narrow and polluted Matter, where perfect Eſſences do bask Eternally in the Grand <hi>Halo</hi> of the <hi>God-head;</hi> or ſhroud and cool themſelves under the mady Trees of Paradiſe, whoſe Roots ſpring from the deep Abyſſes of Eternity; and are waſh'd by Springs and Streams warbling along the verdant Banks of ſweet <hi>Chioſchs,</hi> and elegant Borders of the Groves in <hi>Eden.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Such are the Pleaſures, which <hi>God,</hi> the Fauntain of Munificence, is pleaſed to treat his Creatures with. He ſtudies to Regale his Favourites, with infinite Beatitudes.</p>
                  <p>There are in <hi>Paradiſe,</hi> Rivers, broad and long as the <hi>Danube, Volga, Niger, Nilus,</hi> or any other noted Current upon Earth. Their Streams run all with Honey, Wine, and Milk, or more delicious Liquors, if any ſuch there be.</p>
                  <p>They are not deep, that timorous Men need fear to Drown themſelves; yet deep
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:102965:139"/>enough for foreign Earthly Souls to ſwim in Everlaſting Pleaſures. Moreover, thou know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt the Saying of the <hi>Prophet; That we ſhall have Women there, whoſe Beauty no Painters Art can e're expreſs; who ſhall not, glance a Look upon another Man beſide their own.</hi> Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, whoſe Beauty ſhall exceed the Luſtre of <hi>Diamonds, Rubies, Hyacinths,</hi> and whatſoever is precious in the <hi>East.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>He promiſes likewiſe, <hi>That we ſhall be ſtretch'd out at perfect Eaſe, on ſtately Beds, under Pavilions of Magnifick Structure.</hi> Where <hi>Pages</hi> fair and beautiful as Pearls, ſhall wait upon us; whilſt Gentle <hi>Zephirs</hi> fan the am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bient Air, with their Immortal Breezes, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king a ſoft and grateful Sound among the Leaves and Boughs of thoſe tall Verdant Copſes, Woods, and Thickets, which are planted here and there throughout the Fields of <hi>Paradiſe.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>O <hi>Orchan!</hi> by all theſe <hi>Allegories</hi> we are to underſtand the Supreme Felicity of Virtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Souls, who die in Faith and Love. This is a certain Rule; That, <hi>whatſoever is pleaſant and agreeable to any Good Man upon Earth, ſhall be either ſuperlatively augmented in Specie, or improv'd by an infinitely more pleaſant Change in Heaven.</hi> So that no Man that dies well, can poſſibly be baulk'd of his Fill of Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs.</p>
                  <p>Shall I diſcourſe frankly and after the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of Friends? I think, when <hi>Atropos</hi> has done her Buſineſs and ours, when ſhe has cut the Thread of Earthly Life; Our Souls will
<pb n="253" facs="tcp:102965:139"/>then awake as from a tedious Slumber mix'd of Joys and Griefs, of Fears and Hopes, Pleaſures and Pains. And we ſhall ſoon ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periment the Truth of all our anxious Fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſts. Every Man ſhall be diſpos'd of, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to his Rank in the Heraldry of Fate. I will not preſume to calculate particularly, where or how: Only in general, this is my Faith. That there are <hi>Paradiſes</hi> of all Sorts and Degrees prepar'd with exquiſite Propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion for the various Kinds of Men: And <hi>Hell</hi>'s as accurately fitted and equally adjuſted, for the Puniſhment of the <hi>Wicked,</hi> to whatſoever Claſs or Order. For it appears to me a grand <hi>Soloeciſm,</hi> a perfect Blunder in Divini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and Reaſon, to aſſert or imagine, That as ſoon as the Breath is out of the Body, our Souls muſt either ſwiftly poſt through all the Elements and Orbs <hi>Above,</hi> and in a Moments Time be ſeated in the <hi>Coelum Empyraeum;</hi> or elſe muſt tumble head-long, in an inſtant, to the loweſt Hell. Methinks, if I were to go upwards, I wou'd tarry by the Way, and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert my ſelf awhile in the upper Region of Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rene and Balmy Air; there to Converſe with courteous <hi>Daemons,</hi> and perhaps with <hi>Souls</hi> of <hi>Gentile</hi> Old Philoſophers and Poets. I wou'd enquire at leaſt for <hi>Orpheus, Homer, Virgil, Ovid,</hi> and <hi>Lucretius;</hi> for <hi>Pindar, Epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctetus,</hi> and by the bye for <hi>Sappho.</hi> I ſhou'd be ambitious alſo to ſee or hear of <hi>Pythago<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ras, Plato, Plotinus, Porphyry,</hi> and ſome other of the <hi>Grecian Sages.</hi> Neither wou'd I for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get the Name of any renowned Wiſe Man of
<pb n="254" facs="tcp:102965:140"/>paſt Ages; for I think the Earth has born but few of late, that deſerve to be mention'd. But above all, I ſhou'd be diligent and curious to find out the Thrice-great <hi>Hermes,</hi> Father of Wiſdom and Science. 'Tis Ten to One, but I ſhou'd viſit <hi>Horace,</hi> and ask for a Bottle of his Beloved <hi>Campagne Muſcadine,</hi> if he has any there.</p>
                  <p>When I had thus refreſh'd my ſelf in the <hi>Paradiſes</hi> of this Sublunary World, I wou'd take my <hi>Congè,</hi> and travel to the Orb of the <hi>Moon.</hi> I wou'd kiſs the Hand of <hi>Menarchus,</hi> who rules all the Inhabitants of that Planet. If I found him in a good Humour, I would humbly beg his Pardon, and intercede for the ſilly <hi>Arcadians,</hi> who boaſted, <hi>That their Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try was Older than the Moon.</hi> I wou'd repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent their Caſe as favourably as I cou'd; put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting him in Mind, That they were only a Company of poor ignorant Shepherds, who firſt broach'd that Blaſphemous Libel; and that their Nation is quite extinct on Earth: therefore they are not worthy of his farther Revenge or Anger; ſince every <hi>Arcadian</hi> who had aſſerted this in his Life-time, has for his Penance, been forc'd to dig in the Mines of the <hi>Moon,</hi> from the Hour of his Death. Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps theſe poor Fellows might fare the better for my Apology: Who knows? But, if I ſound that my Requeſt was granted, and theſe unfortunate <hi>Arcadians</hi> being releas'd from the <hi>Sub-Cynthian</hi> Dungeons, were per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to return to Earth again; I wou'd charge them to have a Caſe how they af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fronted
<pb n="255" facs="tcp:102965:140"/>ſuch a Potent Neighbour next Time.</p>
                  <p>Having done ſo good a Work, I wou'd ſlip through the Orb of <hi>Mercury</hi> as nimbly as I could, leſt that cunning Thief ſhou'd: ſteal the Teeth out of my Head. And juſt paying my Reſpects to Lady <hi>Venus en paſſant,</hi> I would ſhut my Eyes, and glide in a Trice through the ſcorching Sphere of the <hi>Sun.</hi> As for <hi>Mars, Jupiter,</hi> and <hi>Saturn,</hi> I have nothing to do with 'em. But what Work wou'd I make with the Beaſts and Monſters of the 8th Sphere? I'd certainly fleece the<note n="*" place="margin">Aries.</note> 
                     <hi>Ram,</hi> and make the<note n="†" place="margin">Taurus.</note> 
                     <hi>Bull</hi> run mad. If I paſs'd by the<note n="‡" place="margin">Gemini.</note> 
                     <hi>Twins</hi> in Pity, I'd eat the<note n="‖" place="margin">Cancer.</note> 
                     <hi>Crab</hi> for a <hi>Viaticum.</hi> The Shell I'd throw to the<note n="*" place="margin">Leo.</note> 
                     <hi>Lyon</hi> to ſtop his Mouth, leſt he ſhou'd ſerve me in the ſame manner. But what a confounded Stop and Pauſe ſhou'd I make when I came to the <hi>Virgin?</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Virgo.</note> What Qualms of Love ſhou'd I have? Till weigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing her in the <hi>Balance</hi> of Reaſon,<note place="margin">Libra.</note> I ſhou'd find her too light. And ſhou'd rather venture on the <hi>Scorpion:</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Scorpio.</note> But I'd firſt charm him with the Myſterious Verſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle of the <hi>Alcoran:</hi> And to make ſure of him, I'd pray for <hi>Noah</hi> and all his Poſterity, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the Old Rule of the <hi>Arabians:</hi> And then I might ſafely paſs by, without being ſtung. Had raſh <hi>Phaeton</hi> been acquainted with theſe Secrets, when he drove the Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riot of the <hi>Sun</hi> ſo madly, he might have rid
<pb n="256" facs="tcp:102965:141"/>over the <hi>Scorpion,</hi> without danger of Burning the World. Neither had he been Thunder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruck by <hi>Jupiter,</hi> and Drown'd in the River <hi>Po,</hi> nor his poor Siſters been turn'd into <hi>Pop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars.</hi> However, as he fell out of the Coach-Box, he drop'd his Turbant on the Frontiers of <hi>Sagitary;</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Sagittarius.</note> which I would take up to ſhield from the Shafts of that ſpightful Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cher. As for <hi>Capricorn,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Capricornus.</note> he's a good harmleſs Monſter; and any Body may paſs by him without Danger. Then I'd quench my Thirſt with <hi>Aqua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rins,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Aquarius.</note> after eating the <hi>Crab;</hi> and ſo prepare for another Banquet on <hi>Piſces.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Piſces.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p>If thou thinkeſt, I am too much in jeſt with the Heavenly Signs, I tell thee there is nothing in Nature more Ridieu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous than theſe Fictitious Forms and Names aſſign'd them by the Ancient Poets.</p>
                  <p>However, my Soul begins to be tir'd with thus purſuing thoſe Beaſts of the Sky. So I'll put an End to the Chace, wiſhing thee and my ſelf a good Repoſe: For it is above an Hour paſt Midnight. Adien.</p>

                  <p>IF thou wilt turn over the <hi>Regiſter</hi> of the <hi>Empire,</hi> thou wilt find ſome of my <hi>Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,</hi> wherein I have deſcrib'd the City of <hi>Venice,</hi> according to the Beſt Information I had from <hi>Adonai,</hi> a <hi>Jew,</hi> Reſiding there as a Private Agent for the <hi>Grand Signior.</hi> There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, avoiding all Particularities concerning the Incredible Magnificence of the <hi>Palaces, Temples, Bridges, Colleges,</hi> and other Publick Buildings; where nothing is to be ſeen, but <hi>Marble, Jaſper, Porphyry, Silver, Gold,</hi> and other Precious Ornaments, which every where dazzle the Eyes of Strangers: I will only take Notice of ſuch Things relating to this <hi>City</hi> and <hi>Republick,</hi> as I formerly o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Venetians</hi> poſſeſs ſeveral moſt Ample, Rich, and Flouriſhing Cities in <hi>Italy;</hi> beſides Abundance of Smaller Towns, Caſtles, and Fortreſſes. The Names of thoſe Cities which are of Chiefeſt Note, are, <hi>Bergamo, Crema, Brixia, Verona, Trent, Aquileia, Vicenza, Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dua,</hi> and <hi>Terviſo.</hi> As for the Towns, they are too many to inſert in a Letter.</p>
                  <pb n="258" facs="tcp:102965:142"/>
                  <p>Toward the North of their <hi>City,</hi> they are Maſters of almoſt all <hi>Friuli;</hi> with <hi>Iſtria,</hi> which is the Utmoſt <hi>Province</hi> of <hi>Italy,</hi> on that Side. They are alſo Lords of the Greateſt Part of <hi>Dalmatia,</hi> with the <hi>Iſles</hi> belonging to it. In the Mouth of the <hi>Adriatick Sea,</hi> they poſſeſs <hi>Corfu, Cephalonia, Zante, Cerigo;</hi> with many more of Leſs Note. Not to ſpeak of <hi>Candia,</hi> ſo well known to the <hi>Muſſulmans.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>From all theſe Territories, the <hi>Republick</hi> has a Yearly Income of Two Millions in Gold: Which is not treaſur'd up for any long Time, but is employ'd in the Publick Expences; as, in Maintaining Military Forces, by Sea and Land; in Building and Rigging up their Fleets; in Raiſing and Repairing Forts and Caſtles: in Paying the Stipends of Magiſtrates, and Publick Miniſters; with other Expences, too tedious to be nam'd.</p>
                  <p>They have other Ways to raiſe Mony in Extraordinary Caſes; as, in Time of War, or the like. For, then they double or treble the Taxes, Tythes, and Impoſts. And All are liable to anſwer the Demands of the <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>publick;</hi> the Noble, as well as the Vulgar. Neither do they ſeem unwilling, when the Extream Neceſſities of the State require it. But, if this be not ſufficient to defray the Publick Charges; then the Magiſtrates, and Publick Miniſters, are oblig'd to wait for their Salaries and Stipends, till the <hi>Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth</hi> is in a Condition to pay them. They alſo, at ſuch a Time, are uſed to ſell the Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of Great Truſt and Honour to the No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles;
<pb n="259" facs="tcp:102965:142"/>who, at other Times, enjoy them <hi>Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tis,</hi> as a Reward of their Merits.</p>
                  <p>If all this will not do the Buſineſs, and they find themſelves reduc'd to great Extre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities; then they borrow of Private Perſons, ſuch Sums as they want, on the Publick Faith. And if any <hi>Wealthy Citizen</hi> refuſe, or appear unwilling to lend his Mony, they uſe Fored and Violence; Seizing his Goods, whether Moveable, or Immoveable, and ſell them for Ready Mony. At the ſame Time, the <hi>Republick</hi> declares her ſelf a Debtor to theſe Men; and pawns her Faith to pay them, with Intereſt, after a certain Number of Years, or when the War is finiſh'd, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording as ſhe is able. And that which is moſt admirable is, that all this is done with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the leaſt Tumult or Sedition, or any Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terior Symptoms of Diſcontent. Nay, This People are ſo prompt and ready to aſſiſt the State in ſuch Exigencies, that it is common for many of the <hi>Nobles,</hi> and <hi>Wealthy Citi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zens,</hi> to make a Voluntary Tender of their Mony to the <hi>Senate:</hi> And, Some will ſell their Plate, of their own Accord; with all their Wives Jewels, and other Ornaments; turning them into Mony, for the Service of the <hi>Commonwealth.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Beſides, Not only the Inhabitants of <hi>Venice</hi> contribute thus to the Publick Treaſury, but alſo the other Cities and Towns under their Juriſdiction; each according to their Ability. Therefore it matters not much, whether the <hi>Republick</hi> have any Bank of Mony by her, or
<pb n="260" facs="tcp:102965:143"/>no; ſince her Private Subjects are rich e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough, and ſhe can make uſe of their Wealth, without any Difficulty, or Ill Conſequences, when-ever ſhe has Occaſion.</p>
                  <p>As for the Strength, and Military Forces of the <hi>Venetians,</hi> it may be ſaid, That there is ſcarce a <hi>Prince</hi> in <hi>Europe,</hi> who has Better and Larger Fortifications than this <hi>Republick.</hi> To defend which, and all her other Poſſeſſions, ſhe makes uſe of the Inhabitants; every <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince</hi> being oblig'd to furniſh ſo many Thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand Soldiers, as are ſufficient to fill the Gari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, and guard the Country from Foreign Invaſion. Thus, in the <hi>Province</hi> of <hi>Lombardy</hi> alone, there are Twenty Five Thouſand, Foot kept conſtantly in Arms. Beſides theſe, in Time of War they raiſe Extraordinary Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, both in their own Territories, and in <hi>Germany,</hi> or among the <hi>Swiſs-Cantons:</hi> From which Laſt, they generally have an Aid of Thirty or Five and Thirty Thouſand Merce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naries: Who are partly beſtow'd on Board their Fleet, and partly in their Forts and Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles; whilſt ſome of them guard the Bridges, and other Paſſes of the Country. As for the Cavalry of this <hi>Commonwealth,</hi> it is very ſmall and inconſiderable for their Number: But being, moſt of them the Sons of Nobles, they are valued for their Blood; which in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpires them with Heroick Reſolution and Bravery.</p>
                  <p>When they are to wage War by Land, they uſually invite ſome Foreign, Petty <hi>Prince,</hi> to be <hi>Generaliſſimo</hi> of their Armies:
<pb n="261" facs="tcp:102965:143"/>Him they endear with moſt Ample Gifts and Honours; giving him Two <hi>Senators</hi> for his Collegues, Men who have been Signally Faithful and Serviceable to the <hi>Commonwealth.</hi> Theſe are call'd <hi>Proveditori,</hi> or <hi>Superviſors-General.</hi> Without whoſe Conſent, and Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probation, this <hi>Generaliſſimo</hi> cannot Give Bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tel, or do any Thing elſe of Moment, from which the <hi>Commonwealth</hi> may receive Profit, or Damage.</p>
                  <p>I forbear to ſpeak of the Arſenal of <hi>Venice</hi> which is one of the Wonders of the World; in regard I have already given a Deſcription of it to the Miniſters of the <hi>Port</hi> in one of my former Letters, which thou wilt find Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſter'd.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Illuſtrious Scribe,</hi> I aim at Brevity in all my <hi>Diſpatches,</hi> that I may not weary our thy Patience: But ſometimes my Subject carries me beyond my Limits; otherwiſe I ſhould be forc'd to conclude ſome of my Letters in the midſt of a Relation, which in my Opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on looks like a Botch.</p>
                  <p>Therefore to avoid this <hi>Soleciſm,</hi> I muſt not cloſe up my <hi>Diſpatch</hi> till I have given thee an Account what Rites and Ceremonies are us'd in Electing the <hi>Dukes</hi> of <hi>Venice.</hi> Which take as follows:</p>
                  <p>The Day of Election being appointed, all the <hi>Venetian Senators</hi> that are Thirty Years of Age, meet together in the Palace, where the Gates being ſhut, an <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rn</hi> or <hi>Chest</hi> is plac'd in the Middle of the <hi>Aſſembly.</hi> Into which are thrown as many little <hi>Balls,</hi> as there be <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nators</hi>
                     <pb n="262" facs="tcp:102965:144"/>preſent. Theſe <hi>Balls</hi> are of Two Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours: For, Thirty of them are <hi>Gilt,</hi> the Reſt are <hi>White.</hi> Every one of the <hi>Senators</hi> takes a <hi>Ball</hi> out of the <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rn.</hi> Thoſe who get the Thirty Gilt Ones are carried into another <hi>Conclave;</hi> whilſt thoſe who have the White Ones, remain in the ſame Place. In the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond <hi>Conclave</hi> is alſo plac'd an <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rn,</hi> into which Thirty <hi>Balls</hi> are caſt. Among which Nine are <hi>Gilt,</hi> the Reſt <hi>White.</hi> Thoſe who get the Nine Gilt ones, name Forty Men, who are call'd, <hi>Electors of the Firſt Election.</hi> Theſe Forty Men, throw into the Urn Forty Balls; of which Twelve are <hi>Gilt,</hi> the Reſt <hi>White.</hi> Thoſe who get the Twelve <hi>Gilt Balls,</hi> are call'd, <hi>Electors of the Second Election:</hi> For they name Five and Twenty other Men. Theſe Five and Twenty, throw into the <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rn</hi> Five and Twenty Balls, of which Nine are <hi>Gilt,</hi> and they who get them are call'd <hi>Electors of the Third Election.</hi> For theſe name One and Forty Men, in whoſe Power it is to Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate a <hi>Duke</hi> or <hi>Prince</hi> of the <hi>Republick.</hi> And they do it after this manner:</p>
                  <p>They chuſe from among themſelves Three <hi>Senators</hi> more <hi>Venerable</hi> than the Reſt, whom they call the <hi>Chiefs of the Congregation,</hi> and Two <hi>Secretaries.</hi> Then there remain Six and Thirty, who give in their Votes after this manner:</p>
                  <p>The Three <hi>Chiefs</hi> ſit in ſo many Seats, more eminent than the Reſt: Then the <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretaries</hi> call the Six and Thirty others in Order before them, where every one Throws
<pb n="263" facs="tcp:102965:144"/>into a Box, in Preſence of the <hi>Chiefs,</hi> a little piece of Wood, on which is written the Name of him whom he would have to be <hi>Duke.</hi> Then every one of the Six and Thirty, retires to his Place: Whilſt the <hi>Secretaries</hi> read the Sche<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dules before the <hi>Chiefs.</hi> And as many as they find there nam'd for <hi>Dukes,</hi> ſo many new Schedules do they make. Theſe are thrown promiſcuouſly into a <hi>Cap,</hi> or <hi>Bonnet;</hi> from whence after a ſhake or Two, to mingle 'em, they are drawn out, and laid in order on a Table. But before they draw 'em all out, the Firſt Schedule is read; and he whoſe Name is written on it, is bid to go into the next <hi>Conclave.</hi> Then the <hi>Chiefs of the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation,</hi> as they're called, ask the Reſt, If any Body there can object againſt the Electi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of this Man? For if they can, and he does not give a Satisfactory Anſwer, he is exclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded from all Poſſibility of being <hi>Duke.</hi> But if he acquits himſelf well, he is acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and has the <hi>Ducal</hi> Crown put on his Head. The preſent <hi>Duke</hi> of <hi>Venice</hi> is the Hundred and ****** incluſively from <hi>Paulutius Anafeſtus,</hi> the Firſt that ever had that Honour; being Elected in the City <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raclea,</hi> in the Year 697 of the Chriſtians <hi>Hejira.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The <hi>Venetians</hi> are in all their Actions very Grave, uſing few Words, eſpecially when they are at Table. If they are not ſo lively and inventive as ſome other People of <hi>Italy,</hi> yet they perform all Things with mature De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liberation and Judgment; which is the Cauſe,
<pb n="264" facs="tcp:102965:145"/>Than their Affairs for the moſt part ſucceed very happily.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Italians</hi> have a Common <hi>By-word</hi> cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent among them, That the <hi>Venetians</hi> are <hi>Magnificent, Crafty, and Diſcreet;</hi> Thoſe of <hi>Verona, are ſtudious and faithful;</hi> Thoſe of <hi>Padua, light and fickle;</hi> thoſe of <hi>Vicenza, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vengeful.</hi> Again they ſay, the <hi>Venetians bring Mony; Terviſo, Swords;</hi> and <hi>Brixia, Pioneers to the Wars.</hi> And that the <hi>Venetians are good Seamen;</hi> the <hi>Paduans, good Horſemen;</hi> and thoſe of <hi>Bergamo, excellent at an Ambuſh.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Of the <hi>Women</hi> they have another <hi>Proverb.</hi> That thoſe of <hi>Crema are fraudulent;</hi> they of <hi>Vicenza, conſtant;</hi> they of <hi>Venice, proud and inſolent;</hi> they of <hi>Werona, gracious;</hi> thoſe of <hi>Brixia, diligent:</hi> Thoſe of <hi>Terviſo, jealous;</hi> and thoſe of <hi>Bergamo, crafty.</hi> They ſay like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, that <hi>Bergamo has many Slanderers; Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dua, many good Soldiers; Vicenza many Counts;</hi> and <hi>Brixia, many obdurate Miſers.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Courteous Miniſter,</hi> thou wilt bear, I hope, with my tediouſneſs in diſcourſing of this Great <hi>Republick.</hi> Which cannot be handled in a few Words.</p>
                  <p>As to the Manner of their Government, it is admirably mild and gentle, wiſe and juſt, ſeeking Peace, but not refuſing War, when they have a juſt Provocation. It is worthy of any Mans Conſideration, how this <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealth</hi> has ſtood firm and unſhaken for a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove Twelve Hundred Years, amidſt ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Cruel Wars, and Potent Enemies; ſo that <hi>her</hi> Subjects, if they be compar'd with others,
<pb n="265" facs="tcp:102965:145"/>may be ſaid to enjoy the Golden Age, ſince they live in continual Eaſe and Tranquility, encreaſing daily in Riches, Honours, and every kind of Proſperity.</p>
                  <p>This is to be aſcribed in the Firſt Place, to the moſt excellent Laws and Rules of Policy left them by Men of ſingular Prudence and Wiſdom, who had they lived in the Times of the Ancient Greeks, might well have been liſted among the moſt famous <hi>Philoſophers</hi> and <hi>Law-givers.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The <hi>Duke,</hi> in the Gravity of his Port, the Splendor of his Robes, and the Magnificence of his Palace, ſeems to exhibit the <hi>Majesty</hi> of an <hi>Emperour.</hi> And yet he has no more Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, than any one of the <hi>Senators,</hi> who created him. For, he has but one Vote in the <hi>Senate,</hi> as all the Nobles have. Only it lies upon him to give Audience to Foreign <hi>Embaſſadors,</hi> in the Name of the <hi>Senare.</hi> He can do nothing without the Conſent of the <hi>Senate</hi> either in Peace or War. The Senate firſt decrees, and he confirms their Edicts. Which are alſo publiſhed in his Name. It is lawful for him to go into all the Courts of <hi>Juſtice,</hi> and Publick <hi>Tribunals,</hi> where he may paſs his <hi>Verdict</hi> in any dubious Caſe, yet ſo as any of the <hi>Senators</hi> may contradict him if they pleaſe.</p>
                  <p>The Form of Government therefore in this <hi>Republick</hi> appears to be an <hi>Ariſtocracy,</hi> or the Government of a Few; not the Richeſt or the moſt Powerful, but the Wiſeſt and the Beſt, ſuch as by a long Series of Faithful Services,
<pb n="266" facs="tcp:102965:146"/>have merited well of the Commonwealth.</p>
                  <p>Theſe make up the <hi>College</hi> or <hi>Council</hi> of <hi>Ten,</hi> which being joyn'd with Fifteen others, and Six Counſellors, the <hi>Duke</hi> being Preſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, has Power of Deliberating and Decree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Things tending to the Safety of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealth; neither can theſe Decrees be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peal'd. This is properly the <hi>Divan</hi> or <hi>Privy-Council.</hi> There is beſides this a <hi>Council</hi> or <hi>Diet</hi> of Two Hundred and Twenty Five Citizens, who are properly called <hi>Senators,</hi> and very much reſemble thoſe of <hi>Ancient Rome.</hi> For none is permitted to enter this <hi>Senate,</hi> but <hi>Nobles,</hi> or the Sons of ſuch. They muſt alſo be above Five and Twenty Years of Age. The Third and laſt <hi>Senate</hi> conſiſts of Two Thouſand Five Hundred Men. But in regard a great part of theſe have ſome Offices and Honours abroad, there ſeldom meet above a Thouſand Six Hundred, when the Houſe is fulleſt.</p>
                  <p>Theſe meet once every Week, that is, on the Firſt Day, as alſo on ſome of their more ſolemn Feſtivals. Here <hi>Magiſtrates</hi> are cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated, and Publick Offices diſtributed with ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirable Order. From hence are choſen the Two Hundred and Twenty Five, who make up the foregoing <hi>Senate,</hi> as being the moſt prudent, expert, and converſant in the Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs of State. Theſe decide all Controver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſies of greater Moment. As the Affairs of <hi>Peace</hi> and <hi>War,</hi> the Care of fortifying their <hi>Cities</hi> and <hi>Caſtles,</hi> of creating <hi>Generals</hi> and <hi>Captains,</hi> of ſending <hi>Embaffies</hi> to Foreign
<pb n="267" facs="tcp:102965:146"/>
                     <hi>Princes:</hi> Here alſo are read all the Letters, <hi>Diſpatches,</hi> and <hi>Expreſſes,</hi> which are addreſs'd to the <hi>Republick</hi> from other Parts. In a word, whatſoever is of more material Conſideration, is handled in this <hi>Senate.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Impartial Effendi,</hi> thou wilt not condemn me as an <hi>Infidel,</hi> or an Enemy of the <hi>Muſſul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans,</hi> in that I repreſent to thee in its true Colours, the preſent State of <hi>Venice.</hi> If we ought to <hi>give the Devil his due,</hi> as the <hi>Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi> ſay, In <hi>God's Name,</hi> let us not rob Men of theirs, though they be our Enemies.</p>

                     <hi>To</hi> Oſman Adrooneth, Aſtrologer in Ordinary <hi>to the</hi> Sultan.</head>
                  <p>THE Inhabitants of theſe <hi>Weſtern</hi> Parts are in a great and general Conſternati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, at the Appearance of a <hi>New Comet,</hi> or <hi>Blazing-Star.</hi> It riſes much about the Time the <hi>Sun</hi> Sets, and in the ſame <hi>Quarter</hi> of the <hi>Heavens.</hi> The Body of it looks no bigger than a <hi>Star</hi> of the Firſt Magnitude, from whence ſprings a Pyramid of Light, extend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it ſelf to the Cuſp of the <hi>Mid-Heaven,</hi> where its Cone ſeems to terminate.</p>
                  <p>The Superſtitious call it <hi>the Sword of God,</hi> becauſe of its Form, being not much unlike an <hi>Old Two-edg'd Rapier.</hi> I am ſure it does not reſemble a <hi>Turkiſh Cymeter,</hi> for thoſe thou knoweſt are Oblique in their Figure, and this is Streight.</p>
                  <p>They are full of Melancholy Preſages, and the <hi>Aſtrologers</hi> themſelves give out, That this <hi>Comet</hi> portends dreadful Calamities to <hi>Europe,</hi> which may not diſcover themſelves, perhaps theſe many Years; Nay they affirm, <hi>That this Generation ſhall be quite extinct, before the Effects of this Tremendous Apparition ſhall ſeize on Earth.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I have a great Veneration for the Science of the <hi>Stars,</hi> and even for <hi>Judicial Aſtrology,</hi>
                     <pb n="269" facs="tcp:102965:147"/>though I cannot pretend to any Skill in any of them. I have ſtudied them both till I was weary, being diſcouraged by the Diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence of Mens Opinions, and the Uncertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of their Concluſions in matters of ſo re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote, ſublime, and myſterious a Nature. Beſides, I fainted under the Burden of ſuch vaſt Speculations, whilſt I found my ſelf ſtill wandring not only in the Blindneſs of my own proper Intellect, but alſo in the Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Darkneſs of Human Reaſon.</p>
                  <p>I conſider'd the Birth-place of theſe <hi>Sciences,</hi> which all will confeſs to be the <hi>East.</hi> And there I found the <hi>Chaldaeans</hi> differing from the <hi>Gymnoſophiſts</hi> of <hi>India:</hi> Theſe again contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicting my Countrymen, the <hi>Arabians.</hi> To paſs from thence into <hi>Africa.</hi> I perceived the <hi>Egyptians</hi> were of one Sentiment, the <hi>Ethio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pians</hi> of another, and the <hi>Moors</hi> of a Third. Neither could I diſcern any Agreement be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the <hi>Greeks</hi> and <hi>Romans.</hi> As for the <hi>Jews</hi> they claſh'd with all.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Plato, Proclus, Ariſtotle, Averroes,</hi> and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny other Sages, aſſert there are but <hi>Eight Spheres.</hi> Yet <hi>Hermes Trismegistus,</hi> with ſome of the <hi>Perſian Magi</hi> addeth a <hi>Ninth.</hi> So did <hi>Azarchel</hi> the <hi>Moor,</hi> and his Countryman <hi>Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bith,</hi> Of the ſame Opinion was <hi>Albert</hi> the Great. Whilſt there are ſome who tax theſe with making a <hi>Decimation</hi> in the Orbs, and taking a Tyth from <hi>Heaven;</hi> for they aſſert the Number of the Spheres to be Ten.</p>
                  <pb n="270" facs="tcp:102965:148"/>
                  <p>They not only thus differ from one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, but through that Inconſtancy which is inſeparable from the Minds of Mortals, they vary even from themſelves. One Day of one Opinion, the next of a contrary. So <hi>Alphon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus</hi> one which aſſerted <hi>Nine Spheres,</hi> and a ſew Years after retrench'd himſelf to <hi>Eight.</hi> This is a Vanity from which the greateſt and moſt Eminent Writers in the World have not been free. Indeed, this Mutability of Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion is Natural to all Men. As if our Minds were ſubject to the Laws of Generation and Corruption, like our Bodies, or as if there were a continual Flux and Reflux of our Thoughts, as there is of our Corporeal <hi>Atoms.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Theſe Authors not only vary about the Number of the <hi>Celeſtial Orbs,</hi> but alſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning their Motion, eſpecially that of the <hi>Eighth,</hi> which is called the Sphere of the fixed Stars. For, the <hi>Chaldaeans</hi> and <hi>Egypti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi> held, it had but one Motion, others af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm'd it had no more. The <hi>Talmudiſts</hi> aſſign it two, whilſt ſome modern <hi>Astronomers</hi> among the <hi>Chriſtians</hi> are more liberal, and allow it Three diſtinct Motions. One, of <hi>Trepidation,</hi> as they call it: And this is its own proper Courſe; which it performs, they ſay in <hi>Seven Thouſand Years.</hi> A Second of <hi>Gyration,</hi> which it derives from the <hi>Ninth Sphere,</hi> as one Wheel is rowl'd about by ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. And this Circuit according to their Opinion is not finiſh'd in leſs than <hi>Forty Nine Thouſand Years.</hi> And if that be true, we muſt
<pb n="271" facs="tcp:102965:148"/>not expect the Diſſolution of the World be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore that Term is expir'd. For it wou'd be Impious to Suppoſe, That the <hi>Eternal Archi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tect,</hi> having made this Sphere for a Circuit of ſo long a Duration, wou'd ſtop it before its Race were fully run; much leſs in the midſt of its Cavern; or by that Time it had accompliſh'd a Sixth Part of its Revolution; as the <hi>Jews</hi> and <hi>Chriſtians</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve. The Third Motion of this Sphere; is called <hi>Rapid</hi> and <hi>Diurnal;</hi> for which they ſay, 'tis obliged to the <hi>Tenth Orb,</hi> or <hi>Primum Mobile.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Then again they differ in the Meaſure of the Time they allow for the Motion of the <hi>Fixed Stars.</hi> One will have them to ſpend a Hundred Years in Travelling <hi>One Degree.</hi> Another brings them to this Station, in <hi>Sixty Six Years.</hi> A Third, in <hi>Seventy Five;</hi> a Fourth, in <hi>Seventy Eight.</hi> The <hi>Jews,</hi> in <hi>Seventy;</hi> the <hi>Chriſtians,</hi> in <hi>Eighty;</hi> whilſt the <hi>Indians</hi> go beyond them all; aſſerting that there are <hi>Two Stars</hi> in the <hi>Eighth Sphore,</hi> Diametrical<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly oppoſite to each other; which do not ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply each others Place in the <hi>Zodiack,</hi> in leſs than a <hi>Hundred and Forty Four Thouſand Years.</hi> They affirm alſo, that there are many Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the <hi>Spheres</hi> above; which are yet un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known to Mortals.</p>
                  <p>If this be ſo, there may be, for ought we know, other <hi>Stars</hi> and Bodies alſo, to which theſe Motions may agree, though we cannot diſcern either the one or the other, becauſe of the Superlative Vaſtneſs of the Height,
<pb n="272" facs="tcp:102965:149"/>and the Imperfection of Human Art. Of this Opinion were <hi>Alpetrag, Phavorinus</hi> the Philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſopher, and others.</p>
                  <p>By all that I have ſaid, I do not pretend to inſtruct thee in Things whereof thou wert Ignorant. I know thee, by general Fame, and the Character of Men of Judgment, to be an Accompliſh'd Maſter in this Myſterious Science. But I reflect thus on the Inconſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy and Doubtfulneſs of Mens Reaſon in theſe Matters, as an Introduction to the Liberty I will take, of telling thee once again my own Thoughts concerning Comets; which firſt ſuggeſted the Trouble I now give thee in this Letter, as I did once before, on the like Occaſion.</p>
                  <p>Suffer me to be a little Prolix and Tedious; for theſe Speculations are Strong, and not handled with Eaſe; or in a few words, I wou'd fain ſee the <hi>Aſtronomer</hi> that has been in <hi>Heaven,</hi> and can give me an Account, what is the True Motion of the <hi>Planet Mars;</hi> or that has diſcovered the exact Ingreſs of the <hi>Sun</hi> into the <hi>Equinoctial Points.</hi> Let him alſo reveal to me the Nature of the <hi>Galaxy;</hi> and what Subſtances, or Qualities they are, which compoſe the <hi>Milk y Way.</hi> Theſe are Subjects which have puzzl'd all Antiquity: And the Wiſeſt of theſe Modern Times, are as much to ſeek as their Fathers. O Fatal Darkneſs of this Mortal State! What Miſts of Igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance and Errour are our Minds envelop'd with? We are perpetually bewilder'd in a Labyrinth and Circle of <hi>Scepticiſims</hi> and <hi>Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biguities.</hi>
                     <pb n="273" facs="tcp:102965:149"/>The <hi>Sun</hi> by Day diſcloſes to us the outward Features and Lineaments of theſe Lower Elements: The <hi>Moon and Stars</hi> are not backward to ſhew us the Face of the <hi>Heavens</hi> by Night: Unleſs ſometimes the En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vious Spirits of the Air draw a Veil of thick black Clouds before the Lovely <hi>Pichire,</hi> and leave us all in Darkneſs. But Fate has hid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den from us the Interiour Pars of <hi>Heaven</hi> and <hi>Earth,</hi> and all the other Beings in the Univerſe.</p>
                  <p>Among the Reſt, I cannot but conceive, we are ſtrangely miſtaken in the Nature of theſe <hi>Comets.</hi> For if they are only certain Heaps of Inflamable Matter, kindled in the Air by the Force of the <hi>Sun-beams,</hi> or by ſome other Influence of Nature, how come they to have ſo Regular and Diſtinct a Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of their own? How come they to Riſe and Set at certain Hours every Day and Night, varying only as the Heavenly Bodies do, in appearing earlier or later, one Day than another, according to the Succeſſive Alteration of the Four Seaſons of the Year, that ſo they may paſs like them, through all the Signs of the <hi>Zodiack?</hi> If the <hi>Earth</hi> moves, and theſe <hi>Comets</hi> be in the Air, they muſt needs be carried round with the Motion of the Whole Vortex. But it is apparent to Human Sight, That they are not thus whirl'd round with the <hi>Atmoſphere,</hi> but have a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinct, and ſometimes a quite contrary Moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. They are <hi>Statick, Direct,</hi> and <hi>Retro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grade,</hi> like the <hi>Planets;</hi> which is almoſt a
<pb n="274" facs="tcp:102965:150"/>Demonſtration, That their Seat is in the <hi>Heavens;</hi> at leaſt above the Interſecting <hi>Orb</hi> of the <hi>Moon.</hi> And if ſo, I ſhou'd be glad to have an Account of their Generation and Original. For, the Subſtance of the <hi>Heavens</hi> being Immutable, and not Subject to any Change or Corruption, it is Impoſſible, That any <hi>New Poſthumous Being</hi> can be generated there. There may, I believe, in every Age, be diſcloſed and uncabineted, ſome Glitter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Forms in the Heavens, which before lay hid, and lock'd up in the Treaſures of the moſt High. But they are as Old as the World it ſelf. That's my Creed. Let other Men think what they pleaſe.</p>
                  <p>If I could wonder at any Thing, it would be at the miſtaken Piety of thoſe, who to avoid the <hi>Charybdis</hi> of <hi>Atheiſm,</hi> which attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butes all Things to <hi>Nature</hi> or <hi>Chance;</hi> fall into the <hi>Scylla</hi> of <hi>Fanaticiſin</hi> and <hi>Religious Dotage.</hi> Whilſt they vainly aſſert, that every New Alteration in the World, is an Effect of <hi>God's Immediate Creative Power.</hi> Not a Child is conceiv'd, but <hi>God</hi> then and there creates a <hi>Soul</hi> for it. Not a Plague, Fire, Peſtilence, or any other Common Calamity happens, but they muſt diſturb the Reſt of the <hi>Eternal Deity,</hi> and make him have a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Chief Hand in the Conſpiracy. So of Comets, they preſage Tremendous Things, as if <hi>God</hi> had immediately created them, to warn this Lower World of ſome approaching Judgments. Whereas, according to the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctates of more Impartial <hi>Reaſon,</hi> they are the
<pb n="275" facs="tcp:102965:150"/>products of his firſt <hi>Fiat,</hi> when he made the <hi>

But, theſe ſort of People Affront God really, for Fear of Affronting <hi>him.</hi> They injure his <hi>Goodneſs,</hi> to ſave his <hi>Omnipotence;</hi> and by a <hi>Back-blow</hi> they ſtrike at both, in defence of his ſuppos'd <hi>Arbitrary-Will. Let not my Soul ſit down in their Cabal; nor my Mind liſten to the Secrets of their Divinity.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>O Sage Oſman!</hi> I believe that all things flow from <hi>God</hi> by an Emanation without Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning, and Subſiſt on him by a Dependance which ſhall know no End. With him the Cauſes of all Fleeting and Decaying Things, have a permanent Stability. In him reſide Immutable Springs, of whatſoever is ſubject to Change. In his <hi>Eternal Eſſence</hi> do live the Principles and Models of all Beings; but he is no daily Labourer. 'Tis a Grand Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt of the <hi>Divine Majeſty,</hi> thus to invade the Reſt and <hi>Sabbatiſm</hi> of the <hi>Moſt High,</hi> who dwells for ever in Infinite and Eternal Soli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude and Bliſs: To make him the Drudge of his Creatures, who has Ten Thouſand Thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand Myriads of Angels to Execute his Will.</p>
                  <p>Undoubtedly he has contriv'd the Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe with ſuch Ineffable Art, That his whole Pleaſure is perform'd by Second Cauſes. This Infinite <hi>Machine</hi> is full of Wheels, and has an Eternal Motion; whereof he is the Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal Spring. If I may deſcend to ſo low a Compariſon, obſerve but the Courſe of a

                     <hi>Miller;</hi> when once he has turn'd the <hi>Cog</hi> of his Mill, he has no more to do, but ſtand ſtill and look on: The Work goes forward of it ſelf, without any more of his Labour, till he Stop it. So the Supreme Artiſt, when he had once ſet the <hi>Primum Mobile</hi> a-going, had no more to do, but to enjoy himſelf in <hi>Eternal Beatitude.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>It is an Indignity to the <hi>Omnipotent God,</hi> to ſay or think, he was not able to make a World as perfect as a Mortal Man can frame the Imagination of. Now I think 'tis very eaſie to conceive, That as a <hi>Hand-Mill,</hi> which continually requires the Attendance of ſome body to keep it in Motion, has leſs of Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice in it, than a <hi>Water,</hi> or a <hi>Wind-mill,</hi> which go of themſelves: So a World, that muſt always have its Maker Slaving and Drudg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, Toyling and Moyling at the Product of every Individual Generation and Corruption; of every New Event, or what appears to us to be ſo, is not ſo Excellent and Perfect, as one that can perform its own Task by the Neceſſary Force which one contiguous Atom has upon another; like Wheels upon Wheels.</p>
                  <p>To conclude all, Undoubtedly the Works of <hi>God</hi> are moſt perfect, and full of Wiſdom. He made all Things from Eternity, and they Obey his Law. He has appointed the Times and Seaſons of <hi>Good</hi> and <hi>Evil.</hi> The Symp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toms whereof appear to Mankind in Various Manners: In <hi>Dreams</hi> and <hi>Viſions</hi> by Night; in <hi>Ominous Accidents</hi> by <hi>Day;</hi> in <hi>Prophecies,</hi> and <hi>General Whiſpers;</hi> in <hi>Apparitions, Spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctres,</hi>
                     <pb n="277" facs="tcp:102965:151"/>and <hi>Monſtrous Forms;</hi> in <hi>Heaven,</hi> and all the <hi>Elements:</hi> Finally, in <hi>Comets.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But, <hi>Oh Learned Adrooneth!</hi> Does it there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore follow, that theſe <hi>Signs,</hi> theſe <hi>Appariti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,</hi> theſe <hi>Comets,</hi> &amp;c. are freſhly created for the ſake of Mankind? Are not various Ends and Uſes of all Things? Are there not the Fixed <hi>Stars,</hi> and the Planets, according to their different Configurations and Aſpects, Signs of Good and Evil, as well as <hi>Comets;</hi> and are not the <hi>Stars</hi> as Old as the World? Why may not the <hi>Comets</hi> be ſo too, though they are revealed at certain Stated Periods of Time?</p>
                  <p>There's one Comprehenſive Reaſon for all, in that double <hi>Query;</hi> and I'll ſay no more to the <hi>Sage Adrooneth,</hi> for whom a Word is <hi>Satis.</hi>

                  <p>THE <hi>People</hi> of <hi>Rome</hi> having eſtabliſhed the <hi>Government</hi> of <hi>Kings,</hi> transferr'd the <hi>Sovereignty</hi> on <hi>Brutus</hi> and <hi>Collatinus;</hi> the Champions of their Liberty, altering both their Right and Title: For they call'd them <hi>Conſuls,</hi> not <hi>Kings:</hi> And ordain'd that their Power ſhould laſt but a Year; which being expired, new ones were elected in their Stead. And the Reaſon why they had Two, was, that if one prov'd guilty of E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil-Adminiſtration, Injuſtice or Tyranny; The other having Equal Power might curb him, and rectify the publick Affairs. They were alſo call'd <hi>Conſuls;</hi> to put them in mind that they were to do nothing Arbitrarily, but in all Things of Importance, to Conſult their Fellow-Citizens.</p>
                  <p>So great was the Joy of the <hi>Romans,</hi> up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on this Recovery of their Freedom; that they could ſcarce believe it was true. But as it uſually falls out in any ſurprizing Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs, all ſeem'd as a Dream. And ſo inve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terate was their Averſion for <hi>Kings;</hi> that they expell'd <hi>Collatinus</hi> from the City, only be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he was Nephew to <hi>Tarquin the Proud;</hi> whoſe Name alſo he bore. <hi>Valerius Publico<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>l<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

                     </hi> was ſubſtituted in his Stead: A Man ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gularly
<pb n="279" facs="tcp:102965:152"/>devoted to the publick Good. He own'd himſelf the Creature of the People, and gave Power of Appealing, from him to them. And, leſt he might offend them by the Lofty Building of his Houſe; which al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo ſtanding on a Rock, ſeem'd ſtrong as a Caſtle; he pulld down the Upper Stories, and made it level with Ordinary Houſes.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Brutus</hi>'s <hi>Collegue,</hi> was no leſs ſtudious, than he, to gain the Favour of the Citizens; even with the Deſtruction and Slaughter of his own Children. For, When he perceiv'd his Sons Conſpiring to reſtore the Abrogated <hi>Monarchy,</hi> he brought them forth into the <hi>Fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum,</hi> or <hi>Market-place;</hi> and having caus'd them to be ſcourg'd with Rods, he beheaded them: Thus demonſtrating, That as a Parent of the People, he Adopted them in the Room of his Perſidious Children.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Romans</hi> being from this Time made perfectly Free; firſt took up Arms in Defence of their New-gotten Liberty, againſt the Neighbouring <hi>Kings:</hi> Next, for the Bounds of their Dominions: Then for their Confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derates: And laſt of all, for Glory and Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire: Being on every Side invaded and mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſted by the Adjacent People. For, they had no Territories within the Walls of their Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty: So that they were no ſooner out of the Gates, but they were expoſed to the <hi>Toſcans</hi> and <hi>Latines;</hi> between whom the City was ſeated, as it were in the Middle. Therefore reſolving to inlarge their Territories, they took one City and Province after another,
<pb n="280" facs="tcp:102965:153"/>till at length they became Maſters of all <hi>Ita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Their Firſt Expedition was againſt <hi>Porſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na, King</hi> of the <hi>Toſcans;</hi> who took the Field with a great Army; having the <hi>Tarquins</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long with him, whom he undertook to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſtabliſh in the <hi>Throne</hi> of their <hi>Fathers.</hi> He made fierce and reſolute Advances, poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing himſelf of the Hill <hi>Janiculum,</hi> and the Avenues of the City; where he beſieged them cloſe, and preſſed them with Famin. Yet, the <hi>Romans</hi> ſuſtain'd all with Admirable Bra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very: And their ſtout Reſiſtance had this Effect, that at length <hi>Porſena,</hi> when he had almoſt vanquiſh'd them, made a <hi>League</hi> of <hi>Peace.</hi> He was chiefly mov'd to this by thoſe Prodigies and Miracles of <hi>Roman</hi> Forti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude; <hi>Horatius Cocles, Mutius Scaevola,</hi> and <hi>Clelia.</hi> The Firſt of which, when he was not able alone to keep off the unequal Throng of his Enemies, every where crowding on him; at length broke down the Bridge, and ſwam croſs the <hi>Tyber</hi> with his Weapons in Hand.

O</hi> King, <hi>becauſe thou haſt eſcaped my Hand, ſince there yet remain. Three Hundred</hi> Romans, <hi>who have all ſworn to make the ſame Attempt.

And as if a Glorious Envy had fermented the Vertue of the <hi>Female</hi> Sex: A certain <hi>Noble</hi> Virgin, call'd <hi>Clelia,</hi> who was given in Hoſtage to <hi>King Porſena,</hi> eſcap'd her Guards by Night; and mounting a Horſe which ſhe found in the Way, ſwam over the <hi>Tyber</hi> on him. <hi>Porſena,</hi> as if he were terrifyed at the Fortune and ſtupendous Reſolution of the <hi>Romans;</hi> conſented to a <hi>Peace:</hi> But the <hi>Latins</hi> would not let them reſt ſo: For they alſo attemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to reſtore the <hi>Tarquins;</hi> not ſo much in Love to them, as out of Spight to the Inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants of <hi>Rome;</hi> being deſirous to ſee that People, at leaſt ſubjugated at Home, who Lorded i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

There was a Bloody Fight between 'em; and the Fame goes, That Two <hi>Gods, Caſtor</hi> and <hi>Pollux,</hi> were preſent on white Horſes, as Spectators of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bat. Wherefore, after the <hi>Romans</hi> had got<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten the Victory, they built a <hi>Temple</hi> to theſe Warlike <hi>Deities;</hi> as a Stipend or Reward to their Champions. And thus far they fought for Liberty; which having ſucceſsfully aſſert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and eſtabliſhed, they were involv'd in Freſh Wars, about the Confines of their Dominion.</p>
                  <p>It would be too tedious to rehearſe the va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Battles and Encounters between them and the Neighbouring Nations; wherein at
<pb n="282" facs="tcp:102965:154"/>laſt they always got the Victory, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended the Limits of their Empire far and wide. Such alſo, and ſo prodigious were the Actions, Exploits and hardy Performan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of this ſtout People, that when <hi>King Pyr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rhus</hi> conſider'd it, he brake forth into this Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clamation: <hi>How eaſie, were it,</hi> ſaid he, <hi>to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain the Empire of the World, were</hi> Pyrrhus <hi>King of the</hi> Romans; <hi>or the</hi> Romans <hi>Soldiers to</hi> Pyrrhus!</p>
                  <p>Yet as faſt as this Victorious People en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larg'd their Territories Abroad; ſo did their Seditions and Tumults encreaſe at Home; raiſed by the Ambition of ſome, and the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>content of others; 'till at length they had en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely ſubdued all <hi>Italy</hi> to their Obdience: In which Enterprize they ſpent Five Hundred Years, before they brought it to Perfection.</p>
                  <p>Then, like a Fire which devours all the Wood it meets in its Way, till its Fury be ſtopp'd by the Intercourſe of ſome River; ſo the <hi>Romans</hi> ceas'd not to conquer to the very Shores of <hi>Italy.</hi> But, when they conſider'd <hi>Sicily,</hi> as a moſt Rich and plentiful Iſland; only rent, as it were, by ſome Injurious Stroke of Time, or Fate, or Chance, from their <hi>Continent;</hi> they reſolved to unite theſe again by Arms and War, which cou'd not be joyn'd together by Bridges, or Peers. And a very fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourable Opportunity preſented it ſelf to them for this Purpoſe; whilſt the Confederated People of <hi>Meſſina,</hi> the Chief <hi>Mart</hi> of that <hi>I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſland,</hi> complain'd of the Tyranny practiſed by the <hi>Carthaginians.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <pb n="283" facs="tcp:102965:154"/>
                  <p>At that Time <hi>Rome</hi> and <hi>Carthage</hi> were Aemulous of each other: Both equally Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vals for <hi>Sicily,</hi> and the <hi>Empire</hi> of the <hi>World.</hi> Therefore under a Mask of helping their Friends and Allies, the <hi>Romans</hi> betook them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to the Sea; but with Real Deſigns to Enrich themſelves with Booty; and adding this Iſland to their <hi>Empire:</hi> Whilſt the <hi>Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thaginians</hi> appear'd like Open Enemies and Pyrates, without any Diſguiſe. Theſe having loſt their Fleets in various Conflicts, their Fate yielding to that of <hi>Rome;</hi> the <hi>Romans</hi> made <hi>Sicily</hi> a <hi>Tributary Province,</hi> and then reduc'd <hi>Sardinia</hi> and <hi>Corſica.</hi> Thus having expell'd the <hi>Carthaginians</hi> out of all the Iſlands of the <hi>Mediterranean</hi> Sea, there re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main'd Nothing for them to Conquer on that Side, but <hi>Africk</hi> it ſelf: Where alſo they Landed, and took above Three Hundred Places of Strength, in a ſhort Time. Though they were ſtoutly oppos'd, not only by <hi>Men,</hi> but alſo by <hi>Monſters.</hi> For a certain Stupen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dous Great <hi>Serpent,</hi> a Hundred and Twenty Foot in Length, Annoyed their Camp very much, near the River <hi>Bragada;</hi> as if this Dreadful Beaſt had come into the World on purpoſe to be the Champion of its Native Country, and Defend or Revenge Oppreſſed <hi>Africk.</hi> But <hi>Regulus,</hi> whoſe Victorious Arms, neither Men, nor Monſters, nor Fate could hitherto reſiſt; made no Stop, till he came with his Army before the Walls of <hi>Carthage</hi> it ſelf, the Root of all this War. Here For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune began to fall off from him, and prove
<pb n="284" facs="tcp:102965:155"/>his Enemy: Yet ſo as only to give an Occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion for the <hi>Roman</hi> Virtue to appear more Il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luſtrious. For though by the Good Conduct of <hi>Xantippus</hi> the <hi>Lacedemonian</hi> General, Thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty-Thouſand <hi>Romans</hi> were kill'd in one Fight, and <hi>Regulus</hi> himſelf taken Priſoner: Yet ſo great a Misfortune could not make him loſe himſelf, or ſink into any Paſſion beneath the Conſtancy and Fortitude of an Invincible <hi>Hero.</hi> The <hi>Carthaginians</hi> ſent him as their Embaſſadour to the <hi>Senate</hi> of <hi>Rome,</hi> to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe a <hi>Peace,</hi> and the Exchange of <hi>Captives.</hi> But he was of a contrary Sentiment, and diſſuaded the <hi>Senators</hi> from hearkening to any ſuch Overtures: Chuſing rather bravely to return to his Former Captivity, there to be Crucify'd; than be Inſtrumental in Word or Deed to the leaſt Diſhonour or Diſadvan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage of his Country: So that though Van<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſh'd, he yet ſeem'd to Triumph o'er his Conquerours. And his lamented Fate had this Influence on the <hi>Romans,</hi> that it made them proſecute the War with more Fierce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and Ardour, to Revenge the Blood of <hi>Regulus,</hi> than in Hopes of Conqueſt. So deep are the Impreſſions of Love, which a Good General Living, or Dead, makes in the Hearts of his Soldiers. Thus the War was renew'd again in <hi>Sicily,</hi> wherein the <hi>Romans</hi> came off Conquerours: And as an Evidence of the Greatneſs of their Victory, they ſhew'd an Hundred and Twenty Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phants taken from the Enemy in the Field. Which wou'd have been a Great Prey, had
<pb n="285" facs="tcp:102965:155"/>they been taken in Hunting; but now ſerv'd only as a Trophy of a more Expenſive Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt. This Victory was obtain'd in the Conſulſhip of <hi>Metellus:</hi> Which was follow'd by a Terrible Overthrow at Sea, in that of <hi>Appius Claudius:</hi> When the <hi>Romans</hi> ſeem'd not ſo much overcome by their Enemies, as by the Prophaneneſs of their <hi>General,</hi> or the <hi>Divine</hi> Vengeance. For he conſulting the <hi>Augurs</hi> before he began the Engagement; Chickens were let out of their Coops, to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve the wiſh'd-for Tripudiation of the Corn they were to feed on. But when the <hi>Oracu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous</hi> Birds would not taſte a Grain; the Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral diſguſted at the <hi>Fatal Omen,</hi> Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed them to be drown'd in the Sea: Saying with an Impious Jeſt: <hi>Since they will not Eat, let them Drink their Fill.</hi> In the ſame Place was the <hi>Roman</hi> Navy Sunk and Deſtroy'd.</p>
                  <p>There were many ſuch Encounters as theſe between them, for the ſpace of Four and Twenty Years and upwards; even till the <hi>Conſulſhip</hi> of <hi>Lutatius Catulus;</hi> when the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my ſeem'd not to advance with a Fleet of Ships, well Mann'd and Rigg'd with all Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſaries; but all <hi>Carthage</hi> appear'd upon the Sea, with the Woods and Foreſts round about it. This prov'd its Ruin. For they were too heavy for Service: Whereas the <hi>Roman</hi> Navy was Light and Expeditious, like a Moving Camp in the Sea. In a Word, they ſet upon the <hi>Carthaginians</hi> ſo furiouſly, and ſhatter'd their Veſſels with ſuch Speed, That all the Sea between <hi>Sardinia</hi> and <hi>Sicily,</hi> was
<pb n="286" facs="tcp:102965:156"/>with the Diſmal Wrecks.

                     <hi>To</hi> Dgnet Oglou.</head>
                  <p>I Am as waggiſh as a <hi>Fanizary</hi> that has newly receiv'd his <hi>Aſpers.</hi> There's more <hi>Satyr</hi> in me at this Time than there was in <hi>Juvenal and Perſius:</hi> And yet 'tis only the Dregs of what I've vented on ſome learned Bigots here in <hi>Paris,</hi> with whom I have been drinking theſe Two or Three Hours. I tell thee plainly; I put off the <hi>Muſſulman</hi> for a while, and took my Glaſſes <hi>Frankly,</hi> or like a <hi>Nazarene.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Diſcourſe we were upon was <hi>Aſtro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logy</hi> and the <hi>Nature</hi> of <hi>Comets,</hi> &amp;c. But God tumble me headlong into the Lap of <hi>Tagot,</hi> if ever I heard ſuch <hi>Blockheads, Dun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, Fools, Sots:</hi> I know not what to call them properly. <hi>Zounds!</hi> How can Human Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon be ſo debauch'd? How can Man be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come ſuch an Inſenſible Piece of Stuff, to think as they do? They made me Bluſh for Shame, or Anger: They made me ſorry that <hi>I was a Man;</hi> to be rank'd in the ſame Liſt with 'em. However, I ſuppreſs'd my boil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>Choler;</hi> I bit my Lips and Nails, and did every thing that Patience cou'd ſuggeſt: (For I uſe to be a very Boon Companion in my Wine:) But at length, as 'tis the Fate of all Diſputers, we grew too hot: There was ſuch a Tempeſt of Words and Paſſio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate
<pb n="289" facs="tcp:102965:157"/>Expreſſions; that we cou'd hardly find a Grain of Senſe. At laſt we fell from Words to Blows; and I, though <hi>Old</hi> and <hi>Crazy,</hi> held up my Head as well as I cou'd.</p>
                  <p>Thou wilt believe, at this Age, I have no great Strength: But, I tell thee, my Cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage is the ſame as when I was but Five and Twenty: I cannot flinch from provoking Dangers; and when I am thorowly inflam'd with Wrath, <hi>Death</hi> it ſelf appears to me in the ſame Figure which Painters give it; a <hi>mere naked Skeleton;</hi> which I have more Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to pity, than fear: If I am afraid of any thing, it is, of breaking its Bones, and ſpoil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing its Shape, in the Claſh of my Fury. So tender am I even of <hi>Death</hi> it ſelf; the Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>durate and Inexorable Deſtroyer of all Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind.</p>
                  <p>One of the Company that was a <hi>Prieſt,</hi> and ſat right over-againſt me at the Table, threw his <hi>Four-Corner'd Cap</hi> at my Head, whilſt his next Neighbour check'd him for his Inſolence. But he was 'full of <hi>Fat,</hi> and empty of <hi>Reaſon</hi> or <hi>Civility:</hi> A great Hulking Fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, that makes a Figure like the Statue of <hi>Pont-Ginello,</hi> at <hi>Catanea</hi> in <hi>Sicily;</hi> only he is a little Taller: But he has a ſwinging <hi>Tun</hi> of a <hi>Carcaſe.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>After he had abus'd me thus; he ſwore, <hi>If he had the Chalice of the Altar in his Hand, he'd do the ſame thing: Nay, if he had the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecrated Wine in it, he would turn the Blood of Chriſt into Poyſon, as he cou'd turn Wine into Blood, to be reveng'd of me.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <pb n="290" facs="tcp:102965:158"/>
                  <p>There was, by good Chance, an <hi>Arme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nian</hi> or Two in the Company (not any of <hi>Solyman</hi>'s Gang) who took him up upon his Menace. They challeng'd him ſeverely to anſwer his Words before the <hi>Arch-Biſhop</hi> of <hi>Paris:</hi> But the Cunning <hi>Prieſt</hi> had more Wit in his <hi>Anger.</hi> When he began to reflect on the bad Conſequences of a <hi>Summons;</hi> he crouch'd, wheadl'd, and fawn'd like a <hi>Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niel.</hi> So fearful are they of a <hi>Spiritual Court,</hi> which is almoſt as bad in <hi>France,</hi> as the <hi>Inquiſition</hi> in <hi>Spain.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Then there was a Captain, an Old <hi>Miles Emeritus,</hi> a <hi>Penſioner,</hi> who having not drank ſuch a Quantity of Wine many a Day, took my Part; becauſe he ſat on my Side of the Table (for he never ſaw me before in his Life Time, as I know of.) However, the <hi>Old Gentleman</hi> ſhew'd himſelf ſtout; and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrated that he wou'd ſtand a <hi>Puſh</hi> for <hi>Souls.</hi> But, there was no Body wou'd op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe him, ſave my ſelf: And I did it in <hi>Verbo Clerici;</hi> not <hi>Manu</hi> or <hi>Enſe Militis, God</hi> knows. I pray'd the <hi>Good Old Man</hi> to be pacifyed: I laid my Right Hand to my Breaſt, and heav'd both that and the other joyn'd, to <hi>Heaven.</hi> I invocated all the <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triarchs</hi> and <hi>Prophets;</hi> I bawl'd at the <hi>Saints</hi> and <hi>Angels;</hi> I ſummon'd <hi>God Almighty him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf</hi> to appear in my Vindication. But no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing wou'd do, ſave right-down Fight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>To it we went, Pell-Mel:</hi> The Fellows on the other Side of the Table were eager: No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
<pb n="291" facs="tcp:102965:158"/>wou'd ſatisfie them but Blood: Their <hi>Rapiers</hi> were drawn; and they were upon their <hi>Paſs:</hi> When I ſtarted up, and cri'd our aloud; <hi>Gentlemen, 'tis the wrong Minute for ye to fight in;</hi> Mars <hi>is in the</hi> 8th. <hi>Houſe, in Conjunction with</hi> Saturn, <hi>and in Quartile with the</hi> Sun; <hi>a very Malevolent Aſpect:</hi> Upon this, they grew all madder than before. <hi>Damn that Aſtrologer,</hi> ſays one; <hi>Curſe upon his Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mach,</hi> ſays another; till at laſt they all fell foul upon <hi>me;</hi> only my <hi>Side-Captain</hi> ſtood up ſtifly for me. I did what became a Man; but 'tis to his <hi>Bravery</hi> I owe my Life. For, one of the Oppoſite Sparks, made a full <hi>Paſs</hi> at my Breaſt, which the <hi>Noble Old Captain</hi> parry'd, with a ſudden Shoot of his Arm athwart, and a Dexteri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty which I can never admire enough.</p>
                  <p>I, that had neither Sword, nor Skill in the Science of <hi>Fencing,</hi> thought it my Part to expoſe my Body between my ſeeming Friends and Enemies, ſince all the Occaſion of this Quarrel was on my Account, as an <hi>Aſtrologer.</hi> I leap'd upon the Table, and ſeiz'd upon the Sword of my Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains Antagoniſt. I ſmil'd upon him at the ſame Time, and convinc'd him that I was not in Anger. I twiſted it out of his Hands with a <hi>complaiſant Violence:</hi> And then the Strife was appeas'd. For, 'twas not he that began the Quarrel, any more than my Old Captain; but the <hi>Priest</hi> was wholly in the Fault; who, ſtraggling out of his <hi>Sphere,</hi> pretended to ſet up for an <hi>Aſtrologer;</hi> and
<pb n="292" facs="tcp:102965:159"/>tell us Things that wou'd not ſquare with Reaſon.</p>
                  <p>My <hi>Dgnet,</hi> thou know'ſt me, and all my Inclinations: Thou art ſenſible, that I cannot ſtoop to the Magiſterial Dictates of Error; nor the Bold Impoſitions of Ignorance: Let 'em approach as near as they will to Truth on the Backſide, they are the further off from attaining it: And ſo let thou and I enjoy our ſelves in perfect Tranquility.</p>

                  <p>HAving in my laſt ſpoken of the preſent State of <hi>Venice;</hi> wherein I omitted No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing that I thought worth thy Obſervation: I ſhould now in Order touch upon <hi>Candin</hi> or <hi>Crete,</hi> the moſt conſiderable <hi>Iſland</hi> that the <hi>Venetians,</hi> not long ago, had under their Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience.

                  </p>
                  <p>There is no Doubt, but ſince the <hi>Conquest</hi> of <hi>Candia</hi> by the <hi>Muſſulmans:</hi> The Imperial City abounds with Geographical Deſcripti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; Natural, Moral, and Political Obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vations on it. But, perhaps they are want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the Hiſtory of that Famous <hi>Iſland:</hi> In Regard the Books of the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> are not much Read by the <hi>True Believers.</hi> And 'tis from theſe only, we can Collect the Ancient Memoirs of the Nations, which were once in their own Poſſeſſion.</p>
                  <p>This <hi>Iſland</hi> was once call'd <hi>Crete,</hi> and ſaid to be the Nurſery of <hi>Jupiter,</hi> as alſo his <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulcher.</hi> It obtain'd likewiſe the Title of <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>catompolis,</hi>
                     <pb n="294" facs="tcp:102965:160"/>becauſe of the Hundred Cities that were in it. And ſome call'd it the <hi>Iſland of the Archers,</hi> in Regard the Inhabitants being taught from their Infancy to handle the <hi>Scythian</hi> Bow, grew ſo expert in that Exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe, that they ſurpaſs'd all other Nations.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Lacedemonians, Athenians,</hi> and other Renowned <hi>Commonwealths</hi> of <hi>Greece,</hi> receiv'd their Laws from Men Born in this <hi>Iſland,</hi> as <hi>Plato</hi> and <hi>Pliny</hi> teſtifie. And yet <hi>Epimenides,</hi> one of their own Poets, gives them a bad Character, when he ſays, <gap reason="foreign">

                     </gap>.</p>
                  <p>They were much addicted alſo to all kinds of Sorcery and Enchantments. A Fraudulent Race of People, Covetous, Greedy, Idle, and Ignorant of ingenious Arts and Sciences.</p>
                  <p>Yet notwithſtanding this, they were ſo powerful of Old, That they could, as with a Bridle, Curb all <hi>Greece.</hi> During the Reign of one of their Kings, whoſe Name was <hi>Cydon,</hi> came up the Uſe of <hi>Pyrrhick</hi> Meaſures; which the Youth being Arm'd <hi>Cap-a-Pe,</hi> danc'd with great Labour and Sweat. And the Inhabitants have all along been ſo tenaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous of this Cuſtom, That it is obſerv'd to this Day among the <hi>Ruſtick Candiots,</hi> on their Holy-days. For at ſuch Times, the <hi>Youth</hi> of the <hi>Iſland</hi> meet together, Arm'd with a Bow in one Hand, and a Naked Sword in the other, with a Quiver of Arrows hanging at their Backs. And thus they will Dance indefati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gably in the Heat of Summer, even at Noon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day; when the Sun ſcorches all Things with Inſupportable Fervors.</p>
                  <pb n="295" facs="tcp:102965:160"/>
                  <p>In Proceſs of Time, this <hi>Iſland</hi> became ſubject to the <hi>Grecian Empire:</hi> And as ſuch, fell into the Hands of <hi>Baldwin, Count</hi> of <hi>Flan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders</hi> and <hi>Emperour</hi> of <hi>Conſtantinople:</hi> Who gave it to the <hi>Marquis</hi> of <hi>Montferrat;</hi> by whom it was ſold to the <hi>Venetians</hi> in the Year 1194, for an Incredible Sum of Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny. And that <hi>Republick</hi> has held it ever ſince, till it was lately taken from them by the <hi>Invincible Ottomans.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>It is worth Remarks; That <hi>Candia,</hi> the Chief City of this Iſle (call'd <hi>Caſtro</hi> and <hi>Candax,</hi> by the <hi>Greeks</hi>) is a Place of that prodigious Strength, that it ſuſtain'd a Bloc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cade of 22 Years; from 1645 to 1667: And after that, a Siege of 2 Years; from 1667 to 1669: In which Space of Time, 'tis thought, 600000 <hi>Muſſulmans</hi> loſt their Lives before it.</p>
                  <p>The next <hi>Republick,</hi> in Order, is that of <hi>Genoua;</hi> a City whoſe <hi>Power</hi> and <hi>Empire</hi> was far greater in former Times, than it is at preſent. For, they extended their <hi>Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions</hi> even to the <hi>Black Sea;</hi> where <hi>Tanais</hi> that parts <hi>Europe</hi> from <hi>Aſia,</hi> pours her Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters into the <hi>Palus Maeotis.</hi> Here they poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſs'd the City <hi>Theodoſia,</hi> or <hi>Caffa;</hi> as 'tis cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led at this Day. They alſo made them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves Maſters of <hi>Cyprus, Lesbos, Chios;</hi> with other <hi>Iſlands</hi> in the <hi>Archipelago;</hi> and even of <hi>Pera</hi> it ſelf, that Magnificent Adjunct to the <hi>Imperial City.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Yet, from the Beginning, they were Feu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>datories of the <hi>Roman Empire,</hi> till the Year
<pb n="296" facs="tcp:102965:161"/>600 of the <hi>Chriſtians Hejira.</hi> For then <hi>Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tharis</hi> King of the <hi>Lombards,</hi> took the City by Force, and plunder'd it. But when after ſome Years it had recover'd its Priſtine Glory again; <hi>Charles</hi> I. and his Son <hi>Pepin,</hi> Kings of <hi>Italy,</hi> and their Succeſſors the Kings of <hi>France,</hi> bore Rule there for almoſt a Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred Years, placing Governours in the City, who bore the Title of Counts of <hi>Genoua.</hi> And when afterwards the <hi>Saracens</hi> had ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>du'd <hi>Corſica; Ademarus,</hi> then Count of <hi>Genoua,</hi> Arm'd out a Fleet of Galleys, invaded the <hi>Iſland;</hi> and having defeated the <hi>True Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers,</hi> took Poſſeſſion of it, and reduc'd it under the Juriſdiction of <hi>Genoua;</hi> whoſe <hi>Power</hi> at this Time, was very great by Sea.</p>
                  <p>After the <hi>Dominion</hi> of <hi>Charles</hi> the <hi>Great,</hi> his Poſterity was by degrees ſo diminiſh'd, that at length it became in a manner quite Extinct; the more Potent among the Citizens took Turns to Uſurp the <hi>Government,</hi> and exerciſe a Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranny over the Inhabitants: Which ſo exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſperated them, that they often ſubmitted them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to <hi>Foreign Princes.</hi> But finding ſtill as great Inconveniences in this Dependance on Strangers; at laſt, following the Example of the <hi>Venetians,</hi> they choſe to themſelves a <hi>Duke,</hi> in the Year 1337. of the Chriſtians <hi>Hejira.</hi> Him they ſent with a Fleet to Conquer <hi>Cyprus:</hi> Which he accompliſh'd with good Succeſs. For, having taken the <hi>King</hi> and <hi>Queen</hi> of the Country Captives, he impri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon'd them, till they agreed with him for a Yearly Tribute to be paid to the <hi>Republick</hi>
                     <pb n="297" facs="tcp:102965:161"/>of <hi>Genoua;</hi> and then he reſtored them to their Native Poſſeſſion; reſerving only <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maguſta,</hi> the Chief City of the <hi>Iſland,</hi> to himſelf.</p>
                  <p>He enter'd alſo into a War with the <hi>Vene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians;</hi> but being overcome in Battel, at his Return, he was Depos'd from the <hi>Ducal</hi> Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice, and thrown into Priſon; another being Choſen in his Place. This was more Fortu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate than his Predeceſſor, againſt the Enemy; doing them many Injuries; but at length, was kill'd in Battel.</p>
                  <p>Then the <hi>Genoueſe</hi> Elected another <hi>Duke;</hi> who going to <hi>Constantinople,</hi> perform'd ſuch Eminent Services to the <hi>Emperour</hi> in his Wars, that he gave him the <hi>Iſland Mitylene;</hi> which the <hi>Genoueſe</hi> held till the Year 1354.</p>
                  <p>After this, they Created one to Rule over them under the Title of <hi>Prince,</hi> in the Year 1381. But not liking his Government, they threw themſelves upon the Protection of <hi>Charles</hi> VII. <hi>King</hi> of <hi>France;</hi> who ſent thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther his <hi>Deputy.</hi> Being ſoon weary of the <hi>French Government,</hi> they joyn'd themſelves to the <hi>Duke</hi> of <hi>Milan;</hi> under whoſe Patronage they liv'd, till the Year 1435. and then Abdicating him, they Created a <hi>Duke</hi> of their own again. This rais'd Factions in the City; whilſt ſome adher'd to the <hi>French</hi> Intereſt, and others eſpous'd the <hi>Duke</hi> of <hi>Milan</hi>'s Cauſe: At laſt they fell again under the Power of the <hi>French;</hi> whom they obey'd, till <hi>Andreas D'Oria</hi> ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving quell'd the Seditions, and pacify'd the Contentions of the <hi>Freggi</hi> and <hi>Torni;</hi> Two
<pb n="298" facs="tcp:102965:162"/>prevailing Factions in the City, one conſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the <hi>Nobles,</hi> the other of the <hi>Commons,</hi> he Eſtabliſh'd that Liberty in the <hi>Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth</hi> of <hi>Geneua,</hi> which ſhe has enjoy'd ever ſince, till of late ſome new Troubles have been given 'em by the Kings of <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Spain.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>As to the Original of the <hi>Genoueſe,</hi> it is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certain. <hi>Strabo,</hi> and others are of Opinion. That this Nation deſcended from the <hi>Greeks:</hi> Whilſt <hi>Thucydides</hi> derives them from the <hi>Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cilians.</hi> They were call'd <hi>Ligurians</hi> by the People of <hi>Rome.</hi> And <hi>Florus</hi> mentions a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Race of <hi>Ligurians,</hi> who dwelt in the Dens and Caves of Mountains, being a very Fierce and Warlike People.</p>
                  <p>But now adays, the <hi>Genoueſe</hi> are a very Polite and Civiliz'd People; of a Lively and Subtile Wit, eſpecially in Merchandizing, by which they greatly enrich themſelves. They are alſo exceeding Induſtrious, ſhun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning no Labour or Danger for the Sake of Gain. They appear Studious of thoſe Things which tend to the Good of the <hi>Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth;</hi> yet are extremely Fickle and Incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant, given to Faction, and deſirous of No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velty: As is manifeſt by what I have before related of them. Which occaſioned a certain <hi>King</hi> of <hi>France,</hi> when one of his <hi>Lords</hi> told him, That the <hi>Genoueſe were about to throw themſelves on his Patronage,</hi> Anſwer, not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſome Indignation, That <hi>they might go to the Devil for Protection: for I,</hi> ſays he, <hi>will
<pb n="299" facs="tcp:102965:162"/>have nothing to do with Men, who are more unſtedfast than the Waves of the Sea.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This Inconſtancy never appear'd more plainly, than in the late Conſpiracy of <hi>Raggi</hi> and <hi>Torne;</hi> which had like to have proved of Fatal Conſequence. As to <hi>Vachero</hi> and <hi>Balbi,</hi> they were like the Dog in <hi>Aeſop</hi>'s Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles; who loſt the Bone, to catch at its Sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow in the Water: So theſe Sea-<hi>Myrmidons,</hi> were not content with the Strong Party which they had made in the City, but muſt needs go to Corrupt the Navy too; which ruin'd all their Deſign: For the <hi>Plot</hi> was diſcovered by one of the Sea-Captains. This <hi>Commonwealth</hi> has been afflicted with many <hi>Wars</hi> and <hi>Plagues:</hi> But none of either Sort ever threatned it with ſo much Deſolation, as the Laſt: The One having almoſt exhauſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed their <hi>Treaſury;</hi> and the Other as near emptied the City of its Inhabitants. As for the Firſt Misfortune, the Scarcity of Mony, the knew quickly how to remedy it; being perfect <hi>Chymiſts,</hi> and Maſters of the <hi>Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pher</hi>'s Stone, if there be any ſuch Thing in Nature. But whether there be or not, this is certain, That the <hi>Genoueſe</hi> are Old <hi>Doctors</hi> at garbling, tranſmuting, and adulterating of Metals. And the <hi>Ottoman Empire</hi> has ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perienc'd it; to the great Damage of our Merchants at <hi>Conſtantinople, Smyrna, Aleppo,</hi> and other Ports, where the <hi>Genoueſe</hi> did put off their Baſe Coyn, to the Value of ſome Millions. But this Cheat may coſt them dear one time or other.</p>
                  <pb n="300" facs="tcp:102965:163"/>
                  <p>The <hi>Genoueſe</hi> appear at preſent more In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clinable to Merchandiſe than to War. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, it muſt be confeſs'd, that this Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealth has brought forth Valiant and Expert Soldiers; as is evident from the Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies of the <hi>Doria's, Spinola's,</hi> and others, who have prov'd Famous <hi>Genorals,</hi> and <hi>Leaders</hi> of <hi>Armies</hi> in ſeveral Parts of <hi>Europe.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Of ſuch as theſe has <hi>Genoua</hi> more Cauſe to boaſt, than of any Strong Forts, Caſtles, or fenced Cities within her <hi>Dominions</hi> in <hi>Italy.</hi> Nay, the Chief City, <hi>Genoua</hi> it ſelf, truſts more in the <hi>King</hi> of <hi>Spain</hi>'s Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, than in her own Strength. <hi>That Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narch</hi> is indebted to the <hi>Genoueſe</hi>-Merchants Eighteen Millions of Gold, beſides the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt of * * * * Years. For this Bill was given in to him in the Year 1600. of the <hi>Chriſtians Hejira.</hi> By this thou may'ſt gueſs at the Riches of this <hi>Commonwealth.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>As to the Manner of their <hi>Government,</hi> it differs not much from that of <hi>Venice:</hi> The <hi>Supreme Power</hi> being in the Hands of the <hi>Senate,</hi> who Elect a <hi>Duke</hi> every Two Years by Lot, out of Four Men who are propos'd as worthy of that High Office. No Man can propoſe any Thing to the <hi>Senate,</hi> but the <hi>Duke</hi> himſelf: Who lives in a Publick Palace, during the Two Years of his Government; and has a Guard of Five Hundred <hi>Germans</hi> about his Houſe and Perſon.</p>
                  <pb n="301" facs="tcp:102965:163"/>
                  <p>It wou'd be Superfluous to trouble thee with an Account of their <hi>Judicial Courts,</hi> the Manner of Electing the <hi>Senators,</hi> and other Publick Magiſtrates; with the reſt of their peculiar Politicks.

                     <hi>To</hi> Dgnet Oglou.</head>
                  <p>I Formerly ſent a Letter to the <hi>Sage Oſman Odrooneth, Aſtrologer</hi> in Ordinary to the <hi>Grand Signior;</hi> Wherein I inform'd him of a <hi>Comet</hi> or <hi>Blazing-Star,</hi> which then newly appear'd in the <hi>Heavens.</hi> I took an Occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion in that <hi>Diſpatch,</hi> to venture my Thoughts concerning the Nature of theſe Amazing <hi>Phoenomena,</hi> which ſo aſtoniſh the Minds of Mortals, and puzzle the Ableſt <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophers</hi> to diſcover the <hi>Origin.</hi> From this Diſcourſe, I paſt inſenſibly into a more Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral One, concerning the <hi>Stars.</hi> I ſaid what I thought was proper to One of his Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion; being unwilling to offend by too much Boldneſs, a Man eſteem'd the Moſt Learned and Accompliſhed in that Science, of this <hi>Age.</hi> For, though I give little Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit to <hi>Judicial Aſtrology,</hi> as 'tis practis'd now a-Days; yet it would have been an Incivility to expreſs ſo much to one that lives by it; and who, for his Eminent Skill therein, is honour'd with the <hi>Grand Signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>or</hi>'s Friendſhip, and a Noble Penſion. But, with thee, I will take the more Freedom; in Reſpect of that intimate Familiarity that has been always between us.</p>
                  <pb n="330" facs="tcp:102965:164"/>
                  <p>That the <hi>Heavenly Bodies</hi> have an Influx on this Lower World; is an Article, the General Senſe of all Mankind gives Teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony to; whilſt every Morning we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyce to ſee that <hi>Glorious Orb</hi> of <hi>Light,</hi> the <hi>Sun,</hi> imprint the <hi>Eaſtern Skies</hi> and Clouds, with his Refreſhing Rays; he gilds the Frontiers of the <hi>Horizon,</hi> and decks the Tops of Mountains with a chearful Brightneſs. The <hi>Earth,</hi> the <hi>Air</hi> and <hi>Seas,</hi> participate of the Vertue of his Beams: 'Tis <hi>He</hi> gives Life to Plants and Animals: <hi>He</hi> renovates the Elements, and every Sublunary Being.</p>
                  <p>So, when he takes his <hi>Congè</hi> every Even<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of our <hi>Hemiſphere;</hi> he ſtill affords us Light, though <hi>but at Second-Hand:</hi> Whilſt he in Perſon, makes his Progreſs to the <hi>Weſtern</hi> Continent, to chear and recreate by his Preſence, the Remote and Solitary Borders of <hi>America;</hi> Fair <hi>Cynthia</hi> is his <hi>Proxy</hi> here, attended on by other <hi>Planets,</hi> waiting in their Turns, and a whole <hi>Hemiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phere of Fixed Stars.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Theſe ſhine by <hi>Night,</hi> for other Ends, no doubt, than meerly to light the Shepherds as they watch their harmleſs Flocks; or ſerve as <hi>Flambeaux</hi> to the wandring Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veller: Yet this is comfortable in our Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentary Darkneſs. The <hi>Mariner</hi> rejoyces, when in the Mighty Waſte of unknown Seas, he makes a Lottery of his Fortune, and truſts his <hi>Soul</hi> and <hi>Body</hi> to a rotten Skiff; where Slavery and Freedom, Life and Death are equal Chances. When he ſtruggles with
<pb n="304" facs="tcp:102965:165"/>Impetuous Winds, and Boiſterous Waves, threatn'd on all Hands by the <hi>Bedlam Fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry</hi> of the Sea: I ſay, he's glad at ſuch a Time, to have the Light his Friend, though it be but the faint Glimmering of the Stars; that he may ſee the Perils that encompaſs him, and uſe the propereſt Means to avoid them. How is his Heart reviv'd, if in the dreadful Storm, he ſpies but one poor Chink or Cranny in the Cloſe Gloomy Clouds, through which the <hi>Azure Sky</hi> can ſhew it ſelf? And then ſome Proſperous <hi>Conſtellati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi> to appear amidſt that <hi>Checquer-Work</hi> of this Low <hi>Orb,</hi> and thoſe Above; makes him take Courage and defy the Powers of <hi>Aeolus</hi> and <hi>Neptune:</hi> He challenges the <hi>Rocks</hi> and <hi>Sands</hi> to hurt him; and mocks the Fatal Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paritions of <hi>Caſtor</hi> and <hi>Pollux.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Yet theſe and many more Inferiour Uſes, were not all for which the Stars were made. They have befides, undoubtedly, ſome Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion, Influence and Power on Earth; and all the <hi>Beings</hi> dwelling on it. Wherever they caſt their Rays, there's ſome Material Emanation felt; An Efflux full of hidden Magick. They dart on Men and other Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mals; on Plants and other Minerals; on e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very Thing that is Compounded of the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lements, and does reſide within the <hi>Sphere of their Activity:</hi> Each darts, I ſay, its own Peculiar Force and Vertue. 'Tis probable, that every Nation, Tribe and Family; each Climate, Province, Spot and Corner of the Earth, have their Particular <hi>Stars.</hi> So have
<pb n="305" facs="tcp:102965:165"/>the different <hi>Species</hi> of all Sublunary Things, and every Individual Being. But how to determine their Influence particularly, by <hi>Divination,</hi> by Calculating <hi>Nativities,</hi> erect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>Horoſcopes,</hi> and other <hi>Schemes</hi> of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrology;</hi> to foretell Things to come; to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>void Prognoſticated Evils; and engroſs all happy Events; to predict other Mens Fates, whilſt we are ignorant of our own, &amp;c. is a thing which appears to me beyond the Power of Human Reaſon, and a Science built on Sand.</p>
                  <p>For, who has numbred the <hi>Stars,</hi> or viſit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Places of their different Situation? Who has underſtood their various Quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, Engagements, Aſteriſms, and Obligati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on? their Tyes to one another, and their Obedience to the Laws of the Univerſe? O that Mortal Man ſhou'd preſume to dive thus far; even, into the <hi>Heavenly Arcana,</hi> the <hi>Cabinet-Secrets</hi> of <hi>God Allmighty!</hi> Will he be Wiſer than <hi>Ptolomy, Caſſander, Eudox<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us, Archelaus, Hoychilax, Halicarnaſſaeus</hi> and many others, moſt expert <hi>Mathematicians,</hi> and Men of a profound Judgment; who have confeſs'd, that after all their Search in this <hi>Science,</hi> they find it impoſſible to make any certain Concluſion from the Configura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions Above; in Regard of the Innumera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Multiplicity of Cauſes co-operating with them, to which we are wholly Strangers: beſides thoſe things which oppoſe or favour the Influence of the <hi>Stars</hi> among our ſelves, and with which we are very familiar; as
<pb n="306" facs="tcp:102965:166"/>the Force of Blood, Cuſtoms, Traditions, Manners, Education, Prejudice, Prepoſſeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, Place and Time; Empire and Subjecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; Diet and Diſcipline: Finally, the Free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of Mind, or its Servitude. All which, they ſay, the <hi>Stars</hi> cannot compel, but on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly diſpoſe and incline.</p>
                  <p>Moreover, they who have preſcribed the Rules of <hi>Judicial Aſtrology,</hi> differ ſo extreme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in one and the ſame Subject; That there is no Encouragement for a Thinking Man, to hope ever to make a True Judgment by their Rules, unleſs he be Divinely inſpir'd within, and have a certain Natural Inſtinct which ſuggeſts to him the Knowledg of <hi>Fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture Things.</hi> Or, he is poſſeſs'd by ſome Preſaging <hi>Daemon;</hi> whoſe Whiſpers direct him what Judgment to chooſe, among the many that may be made upon the Sight of a <hi>Scheme,</hi> according to the Variety of Rules that have been given. And this is the Opinion of the <hi>Learned Hali,</hi> my Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tryman, who has had many Followers: So that after all, this boaſted <hi>Science</hi> will ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther deſerve the Name of <hi>Sortilogy,</hi> than <hi>Aſtrology;</hi> whilſt all its Dictates depend on pure Conjecture, or the <hi>Extempore</hi> Affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions of the <hi>Mind;</hi> or which is worſt of all, on the <hi>Afflatus</hi> of Buſy, Intereſſed Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits, <hi>Genii,</hi> or <hi>Daemons</hi> of the Air, who have ſome Deſign of their own to purſue, and make Men their Tools to execute it.</p>
                  <p>Undoubtedly, they both deceive others, and are deceiv'd themſelves; who practiſe
<pb n="307" facs="tcp:102965:166"/>this Vain Art, <hi>for the Sake of Filthy Lucre.</hi> For, if there was any thing of Truth in it; how came they to fail ſo often, and ſo egregiouſly in their Predictions? Or, why do they always couch their <hi>Prognoſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations</hi> in ſuch Ambiguous Terms; that like the <hi>Delphick Oracle,</hi> may be taken in which Senſe you pleaſe, and applyed to any Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, Prince, Time, or Perſon; as the <hi>Aſtro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loger</hi> ſhall pleaſe to comment, after ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of what he has ſaid at random may have happen'd? For from that infinite Varie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of <hi>Stars</hi> and <hi>Aſpects,</hi> it is very eaſie for a Bold <hi>Sophiſter</hi> in this <hi>Art,</hi> to cull out ſuch for his Turn, as ſhall be proper to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince Ignorant People, that he was in the Right when he promis'd them Long Life, Health, Honours, Riches, Children, Friends, Power, Victory, the Enjoyment of their Loves, and ſuch like; or threatned the quite con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary; even juſt as they fall out. But, if at any Time they were catch'd in an apparent Falſhood, then they either com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plement a Man into a good Opinion of them, by telling him, <hi>A Wiſe Man has Dominion over the Stars;</hi> or they inſult o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver him by a Thouſand Conrempts of <hi>his ſuppos'd Folly;</hi> which, they ſay, <hi>reſiſted the Influence of the Stars, and hinder'd their good Effect.</hi> Yet, theſe Sort of People are in Chiefeſt Requeſt among the Princes and Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentates of the Earth; eſpeclally in the <hi>East,</hi> where there's nothing to be done either in Peace or War, without firſt conſulting the
<pb n="308" facs="tcp:102965:167"/>
                     <hi>Aſtrologer.</hi> Though really there is not a more <hi>unprofitable,</hi> not to ſay a more <hi>peſtilent Race of Men in a Commonwealth.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Cornelius Tacitus,</hi> a grave Author, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain'd of 'em in Old Time: So did <hi>Varro,</hi> with other Sincere <hi>Writers.</hi> And it was a Cuſtom in <hi>Alexandria</hi> formerly, for <hi>Aſtrolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers</hi> to pay a certain Tribute, which they call'd <hi>Fools-pence,</hi> becauſe it was taken from the Gain which the <hi>Aſtrologers</hi> made by their own Ingenious Folly, and the Credulous Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage of their Admirers.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>My Dgnet,</hi> if our Lives and Fortunes de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend upon the <hi>Stars,</hi> what Reaſon have we to be afraid of any Thing? Why are we ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licitous, and full of Needleſs Cares? Let us leave all Things to <hi>God:</hi> And the <hi>Heavens,</hi> which cannot err, nor tranſgreſs the <hi>Decrees</hi> of <hi>Fate;</hi> will be our Guarantees till Death. But if our Lives and Fortunes are altogether Independent of the <hi>Celeſtial</hi> Bodies, let us bid <hi>good-Night</hi> to <hi>Aſtrology,</hi> as the Vaineſt <hi>Ape,</hi> or <hi>Mimick</hi> of a <hi>Science,</hi> that ever Buf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foon'd the World.</p>
                  <p>'Twas ſaid of Old by the <hi>Sages</hi> of <hi>Chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daea, That God had committed the Diſpoſal of Days to</hi> Moſes, <hi>and of Hours to</hi> Jeſus <hi>the Son of</hi> Mary; but, <hi>That he had reſerv'd the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments to himſelf, and his laſt Favourite.</hi> Let us therefore every Minute of our Lives wait on him, <hi>the Father of all things,</hi> with an en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire Reſignation.</p>
                  <p>But, there is a ſort of <hi>Puny-Spirited Men,</hi> ſo timorous and void of True Faith, That
<pb n="309" facs="tcp:102965:167"/>they will rather believe any Thing, though the moſt Incongruous Fictions of <hi>Hobgoblins, Ghoſts,</hi> &amp;c. than the Dictates of Solid Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon. They tremble at the Report of Things which have no Exiſtence in Nature; and whoſe very <hi>Idea</hi> is full of Impoſſibilities and Contradictions. Yet they will ſtand the <hi>Brunt</hi> of Truth with Brazen Foreheads, and reſiſt the Dint of Rational Arguments, like ſo many <hi>Coloſſus's.</hi> Hence it comes to paſs, That whereas one Lie is apt to take away the Reputation of any <hi>Honeſt Man,</hi> ſo that he ſhall not be believ'd when he ſpeaks true; On the contrary here in our Caſe, if an <hi>Aſtrologer</hi> in his <hi>Random-Predictions,</hi> by mere Chance hits upon remarkable Truth, it pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cures him Credit for all the Lies that ever he has, or can be guilty of. Impertinent and prepoſterous ſort of Fellows; who, whilſt they pretend to know, and foretel Future Things, are ignorant of that which is Paſt, or Preſent; and when they are impudently aſſerting their Familiarity with the <hi>Houſes</hi> of the <hi>Twelve Signs</hi> in the <hi>Zodiack,</hi> know not what is done in their own Homes, and Beds: As this <hi>Epigram</hi> ſays:</p>
                  <q>
                     <l>Astra tibi aethereo pandunt ſeſe omnia Vati;</l>
                     <l>Omnibus &amp; quae ſint Fata futura monent.</l>
                     <l>Omnibus aſt <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>xor, quòd ſe tua publicat, id te</l>
                     <l>Aſtra, licèt videant Omnia, nulla monent.</l>
                  </q>
                  <pb n="310" facs="tcp:102965:168"/>
                  <p>But that which appears moſt ſtrange is, That they aſcribe the very Gift of <hi>Propheſie</hi> to the <hi>Stars;</hi> alſo the <hi>Origin</hi> of <hi>Religions,</hi> the Secrets of <hi>Conſcience;</hi> the Power of <hi>working Miracles,</hi> and <hi>Caſting out Devils;</hi> the <hi>Efficacy of Prayers,</hi> and even our <hi>Immortal Happineſs or Miſery after this Life.</hi> Thus they aſſert, That when <hi>Gemini</hi> is the <hi>Aſcendant,</hi> and in Conjunction with <hi>Saturn</hi> and <hi>Mercury</hi> under <hi>Aquarius,</hi> in the <hi>Ninth Houſe, a Prophet is Born at that Time.</hi> And therefore <hi>Jeſus</hi> the <hi>Meſſias</hi> was endu'd with ſo many Matchleſs Gifts and Abilities, becauſe he had <hi>Saturn</hi> in his <hi>Configuration</hi> with <hi>Gemini.</hi>
                  </p>

                  <p>They add, That whoſoever has <hi>Mars</hi> hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pily plac'd in the <hi>Ninth Houſe,</hi> at his <hi>Nativi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,</hi> ſhall have Power to Expel <hi>Daemons</hi> from the poſſeſs'd; And whoſoever has the <hi>Moon</hi> with <hi>Jupiter</hi> in Conjunction with the <hi>Dra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gons Head,</hi> in the <hi>Zenith,</hi> and ſhall pray to <hi>God,</hi> whatſoever he deſires ſhall be granted: And that <hi>Immortal Felicity</hi> depends on <hi>Jupiter</hi> and <hi>Saturn,</hi> if they be happily poſited in <hi>Leo.</hi> For, whoſoever has this Configuration, his <hi>Soul</hi> after Death being freed from Infinite Streights and Perils, ſhall aſcend to its Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal and Native Seat, the Region of Endleſs Liberty and Bliſs.</p>
                  <p>All this may be true, for ought I know; but till I have a Demonſtration for it, I ſhall deſire to ſuſpend my Belief. In the mean while, this is my Faith, <hi>That all Things depend on Everlaſting Deſtiny.</hi> Whether the <hi>Stars</hi> be Inſtruments in Executing the <hi>Eternal Decrees</hi> or no, it matters not much. <hi>All ſublunary Beings muſt obey the Law that cannot be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voked.</hi>

                     <hi>To</hi> Ibro Kalphaſer, Effendi, <hi>a</hi> Man <hi>of</hi> Letters <hi>at</hi> Conſtantinople.</head>
                  <p>I Congratulate the Honour thou haſt, in be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing made <hi>Superviſor</hi> of that Noble Work; <hi>an <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſal Hiſtory of the World.</hi> I wiſh thee and the other Undertakers, a Whole <hi>Hegyra</hi> of <hi>Happineſs;</hi> whoſe Date may com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mence with the Finiſhing this Illuſtrious Vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lume.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Mufti</hi> has ordered me to addreſs to thee ſuch farther Inſtructions as are neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary to render the Hiſtory complete; that nothing either of Subſtance or Ornament may be wanting.</p>
                  <p>I formerly ſent that <hi>Patriarch of the Faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful,</hi> a <hi>Scheme,</hi> or <hi>Model</hi> of the Whole Work, which I drew up in the Beſt Manner I cou'd for the Time that was allowed me. Now I ſend thee one more ample and correct; 'tis inclos'd in the Box which comes with this: Wherein thou wilt alſo find a large Catalogue of <hi>Hiſtorians;</hi> containing almoſt all that have written the Affairs of King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms and Empires, ſince the Beginning of the World; With their particular Characters; that thou mayſt diſtinguiſh ſuch as are wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy of Credit, from the Authors of Fig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. Neither art thou to wonder, that I
<pb n="314" facs="tcp:102965:170"/>have in theſe Papers, given thee Cautions how to uſe, even ſome of thoſe whom we eſteem of greateſt Integrity and Reputati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. For, though they ſcorned to broach Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles, or tranſmit Romances to Poſterity; yet they were Fleſh and Blood as well as other Men; and many times their Intereſt or Paſſions byaſs'd their Judgment, and drew their Pens into Cabal with a Party. Thus <hi>Herodotus</hi> himſelf, though otherwiſe a Man of approv'd Veracity; yet, when he relates the Wars of the <hi>Athenians,</hi> appears too partial to his darling Country-Men; and lets thoſe Paſſages eſcape his Pen in their Favour, which are contradicted by <hi>Plutarch</hi> and other more diſintereſſed Writers, and for which he is particularly reproached by <hi>Plutarch,</hi> in a Treatiſe of his, entituled [<hi>Of the Malice of</hi> Herodotus.]</p>
                  <p>Therefore, in Caſes of this Nature, thou art not to confide wholly in any one Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor, whom thou haſt Reaſon to ſuſpect guilty of Fiction in Hiſtory; or ſupinely paſs thy Sentiments into thoſe of another, without examining whether his Relations be true or falſe: But having ſo great a Throng of Teſtimonies, reſerve the laſt Appeal to thy ſelf, and let thy own Judgment be the <hi>Tribunal,</hi> where every ones Sentence is final<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly determin'd.</p>
                  <p>Thus much may ſerve for a Direction, as to the Matter of the Hiſtory. What con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns the ſeveral Periods of Time, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in Things were done; Authors cannot with
<pb n="315" facs="tcp:102965:170"/>ſuch Reaſon, be ſuppos'd deſignedly Faulty, as miſtaken in their <hi>Chronology;</hi> and thoſe chiefly, who wrote in later Times; and ſeem only to have collected and tranſcribed out of others, what was for their Turn. And, thou wilt have Reaſon, to be particularly circumſpect, in what thou takeſt on the Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit of <hi>Diodorus Siculus, Pliny, Paterculus,</hi> and ſome others; who ſeem to have been too Precipitate in fixing the Terms and Peri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ods of Time, requiſite to the Illuſtrating their Hiſtories, without making a due Compari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of the ſeveral <hi>Epocha's</hi> in Uſe among the Precedent <hi>Hiſtorians;</hi> from whom they borrow their Light.</p>
                  <p>In Order therefore, to the rendring this <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſal Hiſtory,</hi> the moſt correct and free from Error of any yet extant; to the Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Honour of the <hi>Muſſulmans,</hi> and Advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage of all Mankind: It will be neceſſary for thee to have a Right Notion of all the different <hi>Hegyra's</hi> or Comptuation of Years, us'd by divers Nations, from the Firſt In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention of Records to this Day. Theſe I have nam'd in ſhort, at the Tops of the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumes to which they belong, in the Scheme I have ſent in the Box. Now I will ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain their Meaning to thee, and ſhew which are of moſt Import in this Work, and which not.</p>
                  <p>To begin then with that <hi>Aera</hi> which is commonly taken for a <hi>Series</hi> of the Years of the World, or a Computation from the ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd Origin of Time: Thou oughteſt to
<pb n="316" facs="tcp:102965:171"/>obſerve, that this is moſt diſputable and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certain of all other <hi>Epocha's,</hi> in Regard it is impoſſible to adjuſt the different Accounts of the <hi>Jews, Grecians, Romans, Aegyptians, A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rabians, Perſians,</hi> and other Nations; not to mention the almoſt <hi>Eternal Chronologies</hi> of the <hi>Chineſes</hi> and <hi>Indians,</hi> which extend ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Millions of Years beyond the ſuppos'd Time of the World's Creation.</p>
                  <p>Wiſhing thee therefore, in this Point, to adhere to thoſe <hi>Epocha's</hi> which are moſt commonly receiv'd in the <hi>Eaſt,</hi> we will paſs to <hi>Noah</hi>'s <hi>Flood;</hi> wherein thou muſt expect no other Light, ſave what is deriv'd from <hi>Moſes</hi> and the <hi>Hebrew Doctors.</hi> Which has occaſion'd many to confound this De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luge, with thoſe of <hi>Deucalion</hi> and <hi>Ogyges,</hi> mention'd by <hi>Ovid;</hi> and other <hi>Gentile Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters.</hi> And indeed, it may well ſtart a Scru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple in a Mind not over credulous; how it came to paſs, that this Univerſal Deluge of <hi>Noah</hi> (ſuppoſing it to be ſuch) was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corded by no other Nation on Earth, ſave only by the <hi>Jews?</hi> As if it had not equally concerned all Mankind, to tranſmit to Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterity, the exact Time of ſo General a De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>population of our Race, made by <hi>Water.</hi> But ſo far are we from finding any ſuch <hi>Memoirs,</hi> that there are no Footſteps to be trac'd of the bare Matter of Fact; or any Mention made of a Flood, ſave thoſe of <hi>Ogyges</hi> and <hi>Deucalion.</hi> Whence proceeded this Neglect in the Writers of <hi>Aſia?</hi> What Intereſt, Prepoſſeſſion or Prejudice,
<pb n="317" facs="tcp:102965:171"/>cou'd byaſs the <hi>Phoenician Antiquaries,</hi> tho <hi>Perſian Magi,</hi> the <hi>Chaldean Sages,</hi> the <hi>Indian Gymnoſophiſts,</hi> or the <hi>Bonzi's of China,</hi> from Regiſtring ſuch an Inundation, as (if the Story be true) ſwept away all the Race of <hi>Adam</hi> from <hi>the Face of the Earth, except Eight Perſons?</hi> Or, ſhall we ſuppoſe that thoſe <hi>Eight Perſons</hi> combin'd together to conceal ſo great a <hi>Cataſtrophe</hi> of Human Nature from their Poſterity, making their Children believe, that they were the Firſt Mortals that ever liv'd on Earth? If ſo, how come the Poſterity of <hi>Sem</hi> to be favour'd with the Firſt Diſcovery of the Truth? And thoſe of <hi>Japhet</hi> and <hi>Cham,</hi> to remain ignorant of their Fathers Deliverance from the All de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroying Deluge?</p>
                  <p>It has been uſual with the Learned <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zarenes</hi> of late, to cry down the Writings of <hi>Manethon</hi> the <hi>Aegyptian, Beroſus</hi> the <hi>Chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dean, Philo</hi> the <hi>Jew;</hi> with <hi>Metaſthenes, An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nianus,</hi> and other Authors of Antiquity; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they have deliver'd Relations which thwart the Errors of theſe Modern Writers: On the ſame Score they contemn the <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſian Antiquaries</hi> and <hi>Poets,</hi> with all the <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cords</hi> of the <hi>East,</hi> as Fabulous and not wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy of Credit, becauſe they have been more careful than other Nations; eſpecial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly than thoſe in the <hi>Weſt,</hi> to conſerve the Hiſtory of the Firſt Ages of the World en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire, and free from Corruption. But, with what Face will any Rational Man faſten this Calumny on <hi>Priſtine Aegypt;</hi> that <hi>ſhe
<pb n="318" facs="tcp:102965:172"/>was the Mother of Fables and Ignorance,</hi> which all the World knows to have been the ſole Nurſe and Seminary of <hi>Science and Truth?</hi> Could not ſhe inform her ſelf aright in the Hiſtory of the World, who firſt taught the Uſe of Letters to other Nations? Where was there any Monument of Antiquity that came not out of <hi>Aegypt?</hi> Or what Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, that was not firſt derived from the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of the <hi>Sun? Moſes</hi> himſelf, that <hi>renown<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Lawgiver</hi> of the <hi>Iſraelites,</hi> had his Edu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation at the Feet of the <hi>Aegyptian Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers;</hi> and the whole Syſtem of his Laws, is but a partial <hi>Epitome</hi> of their Statutes; which, by Adding, Diminiſhing, and Alter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, he fitted to the peculiar Tradition and Cuſtoms of the Offspring of <hi>Jacob.</hi> And, why may we not ſuppoſe he did the ſame in the Hiſtorical Part of his Books? Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly ſo far as tended to beget Faith and Reverence in his Readers, to the Sanctity of that which he celebrates under the Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle of the <hi>Holy Line:</hi> In which <hi>Noah</hi> was the <hi>Janus with Two Faces;</hi> one looking back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, on the <hi>Old World;</hi> the other forward, regarding the Future <hi>Ages of the New?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I ſpeak with Freedom, and after the Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of the <hi>Scepticks,</hi> believing that the Boldeſt Diſquiſitions, even in Things which are of <hi>Divine Aſſurance,</hi> are the beſt Means to eſtabliſh the Truth. Let it not paſs there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, for an Argument of <hi>Infidelity</hi> or <hi>Athe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſm</hi> (which ſome are pleas'd to lay to my Charge) in that I ſtrive to recover the loſt
<pb n="319" facs="tcp:102965:172"/>Antiquities of the World, out of the Ruins of Time and Ignorance: And, that to this End, I even call in Queſtion thoſe Records, which being father'd on <hi>Moſes,</hi> paſs for <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Oracles;</hi> which contain Paſſages repug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant to Human Reaſon; and appear infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitely more Fabulous than thoſe, which for their Sake, are condemn'd as ſuch, by the <hi>Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſtitious Nazarenes.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>In all this I have not contradicted the <hi>Alcoran,</hi> which confirms the <hi>Scriptures of the Old Teſtament;</hi> but declares at the ſame Time, that <hi>the Devil has inſerted many Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors into them:</hi> 'Tis only againſt theſe Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors I diſpute, adoring the Truth wherever I find it; though it were written in Parch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, made of the Skin of an <hi>Infidel;</hi> which thou know'ſt, <hi>is as great an Abomination as the Fleſh of a Hog.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But, to return to <hi>Noah</hi>'s <hi>Flood,</hi> or that of <hi>Ogyges</hi> or <hi>Deucalion</hi>'s, which thou wilt; (for as the Firſt is an <hi>Epocha</hi> of the <hi>Jews,</hi> ſo the Two Latter are remarkable <hi>Aera's</hi> to the <hi>Gentiles</hi>) thou wilt do well in uſing all Three, and leave the Scrutiny to others; for 'twill involve them in a Labyrinth of Knotty Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſputes.</p>
                  <p>The Next <hi>Epocha</hi> among the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> is taken from the Burning of <hi>Ida;</hi> whereby Men occaſionally found out the Way to melt Iron, and form it to their Neceſſary Uſes; and the next to that, is the Tranſlation of <hi>Ganymede:</hi> Then the Building of <hi>Troy:</hi> Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter that, the Expedition of <hi>Jaſon</hi> to get the
<pb n="320" facs="tcp:102965:173"/>
                     <hi>Golden Fleece:</hi> And 45 Years after that, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins the great <hi>Epocha</hi> of the <hi>Grecians;</hi> the Firſt <hi>Olympiad</hi> inſtituted by <hi>Hercules:</hi> Next ſucceed the <hi>Olympiads</hi> of <hi>Iphitus.</hi> I ſhou'd have mention'd the <hi>Jewiſh Epocha;</hi> which begins with their Departure out of <hi>Aegypt.</hi> But, in Regard this is only us'd by the Writers of that Nation, thou wilt not find it of any great Import. The Years of <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bonaſſer</hi> are of general Obſervation: So is the <hi>Epocha</hi> from the Building of <hi>Rome:</hi> The <hi>Aera</hi> of <hi>Alexander the Great,</hi> is uſed by my Country-Men, the <hi>Arabian Writers.</hi> The <hi>Capitoline Games</hi> is an <hi>Aera,</hi> mention'd by ſome <hi>Roman Authors,</hi> but not of General Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mark.</p>
                  <p>Theſe are all that are of any Note in Ancient Hiſtory; for as to the <hi>Auguſtan Years,</hi> or thoſe reckon'd from the Battle of <hi>Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um,</hi> they continued not long, and are but ſparingly mention'd in Hiſtory: But I had almoſt forgot the <hi>Calippick Periods,</hi> which muſt not be omitted; and therefore I have plac'd them at the Top of a <hi>Column</hi> in the <hi>Scheme:</hi> They commence from the Famous Battel between <hi>Alexander</hi> and <hi>Darius</hi> at <hi>Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bela;</hi> wherein the <hi>Perſians</hi> receiv'd a Total Defeat.</p>
                  <p>As to more <hi>Modern Hiſtory,</hi> thou wilt have Occaſion to uſe the <hi>Chriſtian Aera,</hi> the <hi>Hegyra</hi> of the <hi>Arabians,</hi> and the <hi>Perſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an Epocha.</hi> Thou muſt alſo obſerve the Difference in the <hi>Julian</hi> and <hi>Gregorian Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ounts;</hi> The <hi>Epocha</hi> of <hi>Diocleſian;</hi> the <hi>Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh

For, they do not all commence in One and the ſame <hi>Moon,</hi> but vary their Dates from the Beginning of the Year to the End. The Want of due Care therefore in this Point, wou'd breed a great Confuſion in an <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſal Hiſtory;</hi> and wou'd render its <hi>Chronology</hi> Intricate and Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeure.</p>
                  <p>Follow the moſt <hi>Ancient Authorities,</hi> and be not diſcourag'd at the Captious Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marks of Modern Writers: For they grope in the Dark; and having ſet up to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves certain ſuppoſitious Land-Marks, whereby to meaſure the Age of the World, they Quarrel with the <hi>Ancient Sages</hi> for ſaying, 'Tis of longer Standing. As if thoſe, who are but of Yeſterday, knew better the Extent of Time backwards, than ſuch as liv'd above Two Thouſand Years Ago. Thus they retrench the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitive Succeſſions of the <hi>Aſſyrian Monar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chy;</hi> becauſe they are dated before their <hi>Jewiſh Epocha</hi> of <hi>Noah</hi>'s <hi>Flood:</hi> And in the ſame Manner they deal with the <hi>Aegyptians</hi> and <hi>Indians</hi> of the <hi>Eaſt;</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe thoſe Kingdoms were in Being, long before the Time theſe Upſtarts have ſet for the Beginning of the World.</p>

When the Tranſlators ſhall have pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cur'd the Books I have nam'd in a Catalogue, there will be nothing more wanting, but the Compilers Care in delivering a Correct <hi>Chro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nology.</hi> Wherein it will be neceſſary to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viate from the <hi>Nazarene</hi> and <hi>Jewiſh Histori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans;</hi> who ſeem to have curtail'd the Age of the World, and repreſented it infinitely Younger than it is, in the Records of the moſt Ancient and unſuſpected Writers.</p>
                  <p>The Ground of this Errour, no Doubt, was partly the Ambition of the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, to poſſeſs a Fame of greateſt Antiquity, and to be accounted Older than other Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries; and partly the Loſs of ſuch Monuments and Records, as were Extant in other Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons before <hi>Noah</hi>'s Flood.</p>
                  <p>Of all People on the Earth, the <hi>Jews</hi> ſeem to have been moſt Guilty of impoſing on the
<pb n="324" facs="tcp:102965:175"/>World an Opinion of their Antiquity, and Aggrandizing their Line above all the Race of <hi>Adam.</hi> And from them, the Errour is tranſmitted to the <hi>Chriſtians;</hi> who giving a Kind of implicit and blind Faith to the <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brew Hiſtorians,</hi> have confin'd the Age of the World within the Compaſs of Six Thouſand Years; whereas, if other <hi>Chronologies</hi> be true, it may, for ought we know, be above Six Hundred Thouſand Years Old.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Aegyptian Chronicles</hi> give us an Account of no leſs than Seventeen Succeſſive <hi>Dynaſties,</hi> or Governments in that Nation, before the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> and <hi>Christian Epocha's</hi> of the Origin of Time. The <hi>Aſſyrians</hi> boaſt of a Race of <hi>Kings</hi> long before <hi>Noah's Flood;</hi> whoſe Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion continued down to the Reign of <hi>Sar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>danapalus,</hi> without the leaſt Interruption or Vacancy made by any ſuch Deluge. But the <hi>Chineſes</hi> and <hi>Indians</hi> exceed all the Reſt of the World in the prodigious Antiquity of their Records. And among the latter, their <hi>Brach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans</hi> aſſert the Age of the World to be little leſs than Infinite or Eternal. The Laws and Hiſtories of this Nation, (I ſpeak of the <hi>Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tile Indians</hi>) are Written in a Language which is now Antiquated, and has no Affinity with any other Speech in the World. And the Books that are extant in this Language aſſert, that it was the Firſt and Primitive Speech of Mankind. None underſtand it at this Day, but the <hi>Prieſts;</hi> and ſuch as they Vouchſafe to teach it to, in their Schools and Colleges. Yet this is the Language wherein are Written
<pb n="325" facs="tcp:102965:175"/>the Hiſtories of their firſt <hi>Kings,</hi> the Original of their <hi>Government,</hi> and the Fables of the Worlds Immenſe Antiquity.</p>
                  <p>Certainly, it wou'd be a Deed worthy of <hi>thy Munificence,</hi> to procure a <hi>Tranſlation</hi> of ſome of theſe Records, that ſo we may no longer be in the Dark, as to the Hiſtory of that <hi>Renowned Nation.</hi> And I could heartily wiſh, our <hi>Chronology</hi> in this Work, might re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive ſome Light from ſuch unqueſtionable Monuments.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Chriſtians</hi> declaim againſt every Thing, that does not ſuit with their Tenets. They ſet up their private Errors as the Standard of Truth; and reject whatſoever contradicts theſe, as Fabulous and Heretical. In this they act like the <hi>Gyant;</hi> who, <hi>when his Gueſts were too ſhort for his Bed, caus'd them to be ſtretch'd out with Engines; and when they were too long, he cut off their Legs or Heads, to make 'em fit for their Lodging.</hi> So do the <hi>Nazarenes</hi> deal with <hi>Ancient Writers,</hi> and eſpecially with ſuch as extend the Age of the World beyond their Narrow <hi>Epocha;</hi> reſolving not to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit of any <hi>Chronology,</hi> which exceeds the Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits of their own. They Retrench whole Ages, and reduce the indefinite Meaſure of paſt Time to a Span. They eſteem the <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dians</hi> as Fools, eaſily impos'd on by their <hi>Crafty Prieſts;</hi> and all the Records of the <hi>Eaſt</hi> paſs with them for Fables, or the Dreams of <hi>Poets.</hi> There is no Reaſon that the enlightened <hi>Muſſulmans</hi> ſhould be their <hi>Apes,</hi> and Mock at <hi>Oriental Hiſtory;</hi> ſince we are Taught
<pb n="326" facs="tcp:102965:176"/>from our Cradles, <hi>That all Wiſdom comes out of the Eaſt.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But they will object perhaps, How is it poſſible, That any Records cou'd be preſerv'd, of the Times before the <hi>Flood,</hi> except ſuch as were Sav'd in <hi>Noah's Ark;</hi> ſince that <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſal Inundation,</hi> ſwept away all the Reſt of Mankind; and muſt needs utterly Efface their Writings and Monuments? To this I Anſwer, That they cannot prove this Inun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation to be Univerſal: Not ev'n out of their own Scriptures; which I have narrowly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amin'd in this Point, and find the Deluge Limited to that Part of the Earth, which was Inhabited at that Time. Which Verbal Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitation Suppoſes, that the whole <hi>Globe</hi> was neither Inhabited, nor Drown'd; or elſe they muſt allow a Tautology in the <hi>Scriptures.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Beſides, it is evident from what the <hi>Bible</hi> ſays, concerning <hi>Noah</hi>'s <hi>Preaching</hi> an Hundred and Twenty Years before the <hi>Flood,</hi> that this was but a particular Deluge, inflicted as a Puniſhment on that obdurate and impenitent Nation where he liv'd, and who derided the Warnings of the <hi>Prophet.</hi> For it cannot be ſuppos'd, That <hi>Noah</hi> wandered up and down over the Face of the Whole Earth, to Preach every where, and warn all Mankind of the approaching Calamity. And 'twould ſeem Partial in <hi>God,</hi> to ſend him to Preach to one People only, and let the reſt of the World die in Ignorance. Either therefore there were no more People in the World, than thoſe of his own Nation; or at leaſt, there were no
<pb n="327" facs="tcp:102965:176"/>more to be drown'd. He was employ'd in Building the Ark, during the Time that he Preach'd; and the <hi>Alcoran</hi> makes mention of the Water that boil'd in <hi>Noah</hi>'s <hi>Pot;</hi> which are convincing Arguments, that he went not out of his own Country; unleſs we will ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe he carried the <hi>Ark,</hi> and his <hi>Pot</hi> along with <hi>him;</hi> one of which is impoſſible, the other ridiculous; and both of them full of Abſurdities.</p>
                  <p>Add to this, that it was impoſſible for <hi>Noah</hi> and his Three Sons, to Build an <hi>Ark</hi> ſo big, as to contain all the Species of Clean Beaſts and Birds by Fourteens; and the Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clean by Fours; and to have Room enough to lay up Proviſion ſufficient to Nouriſh his Family, with ſuch an Infinite Number of Living Creatures: Some of which would multiply upon him every Moon; others, in a little more Time; and all of them within the Year that they were confin'd to the Ark: For ſo long did the Flood laſt.</p>
                  <p>It is evident then, that it was but a Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Deluge; and that the <hi>Ark</hi> was made only large enough to contain the <hi>Species</hi> of Beaſts and Birds peculiar to that Country. For if it were otherwiſe, another Difficulty will ſtart, How all the Innumerable Kinds of Beaſts could Tranſport themſelves from the Iſlands, and Remote Regions, to the <hi>Ark;</hi> and from thence, back again to the Places from whence they came; after the <hi>Flood</hi> was abated, and dried up?</p>
                  <pb n="328" facs="tcp:102965:177"/>
                  <p>A great deal more might be ſaid; but this is ſufficient to render it very Probable, if not to Demonſtrate, that this was no more than a particular Deluge, by which <hi>God</hi> was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolv'd to Exterminate the <hi>Infidels</hi> out of that Land: Even as he has inflicted Judgments as Terrible on other Nations; deſtroying them by Lightning, or Vehement Winds, or by Armies of Wild Beaſts; as the <hi>Alcoran</hi> often intimates. Other Hiſtories ſpeak of. Whole Cities in <hi>Africk, with all their Inhabitants, turned into Stone, in one Nights Time, as a Puniſhment of their Wallowing in that Vice; whoſe very Imagination creates a Horrour in Chaste Souls.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Suppoſing therefore, that only <hi>Armenia,</hi> or the Adjacent Countries, were overwhelm'd in this Deluge; it will be eaſie to ſuggeſt, that the other Nations, ſuch as <hi>Aegypt, China,</hi> and the <hi>Indies,</hi> might retain their <hi>Chronologies</hi> uncorrupt, from the Original Source of Time.</p>
                  <p>It is of great Importance to True Hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, that this point ſhou'd be throughly exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>min'd, and the Extent of the Flood adjuſted. For, if it could be apparently made out, that <hi>Noah</hi>'s <hi>Flood</hi> was but ſuch another as thoſe of <hi>Ogyges</hi> and <hi>Deucalion;</hi> all the Miſts which darken Antiquity, would Vaniſh. The whole Firmament of <hi>Chronology</hi> would become Clear and Serene; and we ſhould Walk in the Light of the Primitive Ages, without being dazl'd, or forc'd to Wink.</p>
                  <p>Methinks, I behold this Light glimmering from afar like <hi>Aurora,</hi> the Chearful Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>binger
<pb n="329" facs="tcp:102965:177"/>of Approaching Day. Methinks I ſee the Splendour of Hiſtorical Truth riſing from the Orient, and Gilding the Tops of thoſe Mountains; which the Ignorance and Super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtition of ſome, the Pride and Ambition of others, have rais'd to hinder our Proſpect of the far extended Ages of the Primitive World. And without Rapture or <hi>Hyperbole,</hi> I dare be bold to preſage, <hi>That a little more Knowledge in the Indian Language and Histories, will bring thoſe Things to Light, which have been hid for many Thouſands of Years, from the greateſt Part of Mankind.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Go on then, <hi>thou Sacred Patron of History;</hi> Go on to encourage this Unparallell'd Work! Send Meſſengers to the <hi>Indies;</hi> Men of Learning and Prudence: Let them Court the <hi>Brachmans</hi> with the Promiſes of Ineſtima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Rewards. Let them try to win thoſe Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nown'd <hi>Philoſophers,</hi> to come with their Books to the <hi>Sanctuary of the World;</hi> that ſo this <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſal Hiſtory,</hi> may Tranſcend all that have been Written before it; and that the Proud Contemners of the <hi>Muſſulmans,</hi> may have this Proverb Common among them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, when they wou'd aſſert any Thing ſeriouſly, to ſay, <hi>It is as true as an Orable, or as the Chronology of thoſe who Believe the Alco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ran. Great Light of the Faithful,</hi> Adieu.</p>

                  <head>
                     <hi>To</hi> Cara Hali, Phyſician <hi>in</hi> Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary <hi>to the</hi> Grand Signior.</head>
                  <p>I Am now arriv'd to a Great Age, and have rubb'd through many Fatigues in my Life-Time. I have ſtood the Brunt of a Thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand Perils, and undergone much Hardſhip. Pains and Afflictions have invaded me in Body and Soul. Labour Perſecution and Grief, have been the Portion of my paſt Years. Now I wou'd fain Live at Eaſe, if 'twere poſſible.</p>
                  <p>Therefore I have Recourſe to thee, my Old Friend, who haſt often afforded me thy Counſel in Time of Need. I do not Addreſs for Faſhion ſake, or to diſcover the Vaſt Eſteem I have for a <hi>Phyſician,</hi> whoſe Skilful Preſcriptions have ſo often ſav'd my Life. No, No: I'm really in Want of thy Aid; and no Man but thy ſelf can Cure me.</p>
                  <p>It is not eaſie for me to define my Diſtem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, ſince 'tis Heterogeneous, and compli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated of many different Maladies. However, it is fit that thou ſhouldſt be inform'd of the particular Symptoms, and the Cauſes, as far as I can gueſs at 'em: And I can do no leſs, than make thee in Part my <hi>Confeſſor.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Methinks I feel the Reverſion of my Youth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Vanities, Inherit the Entail of my paſt
<pb n="331" facs="tcp:102965:178"/>Pleaſures; which is certainly nothing but Pain and Torment. Thoſe Agonies which I laugh'd at in other Men, are now fallen to my own Share. The <hi>Comedies</hi> of my Green<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er Years, are become the Senſible <hi>Tragedies</hi> of my Weather-beaten Age. Whilſt I Sweat, Frown, and make a Thouſand Grimaces at the Anguiſh given me by the Gout, Stone, Strangury, Cholick, Cramp, and other Acute Diſeaſes, which Excruciate me by Turns: I think the Divine <hi>Nemeſis</hi> has appointed ſome <hi>Devil,</hi> for an Inquiſitor and Tormenter of eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Bone, Vein, Artery, Nerve, Muſcle, and Gut in my Body. Surely, I'm laid in the Firſt Pickle of Nature's Wrath: I wiſh it may be the Laſt. For I do not in the leaſt covet her Ill-Will.</p>
                  <p>Then I have my Succeſſive Intervals of Dropſies, <hi>Aſthma's, Dyſenteries, Fevers, Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumptions;</hi> and <hi>God</hi> knows how many more <hi>Species</hi> of Sickneſs. Yet ſometimes I am as ſeemingly well in Health, as <hi>Marogli Zu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſtan,</hi> the Old <hi>Aga</hi> that liv'd juſt by the <hi>Obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lisk</hi> in the <hi>Hippodrom,</hi> who ran away from his Father in his Youth, and ſerv'd Seventeen Years in the Wars of <hi>Perſia;</hi> liv'd till he was Eighty and Nine Years Old; yet never was let Blood, took Phyſick, or was Sick in all his Life.</p>
                  <p>I proteſt, 'tis hard for me to gueſs at my own Conſtitution, or to find out the Originals of thoſe different Habits in my Body. Yet I have a feeling Senſe of that my ſelf, which I cannot expreſs to another.</p>
                  <pb n="332" facs="tcp:102965:179"/>
                  <p>Sometimes I think there is ſome Native and Radical Venom in my Body, deriv'd from the Influence of Malignant Stars, that had the Dominion at my Birth; though how, or why it ſhould be ſo, I am altogether Ignorant. Neither can any <hi>Aſtrologer,</hi> with all his Schemes and Heavenly Figures, convince me which of the Conſtellations or Planets did me the Fatal Injury. I give no Credit to their Antiquated Tales of Trines, Conjun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions, Oppoſitions, Quartiles, and the Reſt of their <hi>Egyptian</hi> Jargon. I believe there may be ſometing True and Sacred at the Bottom of <hi>Aſtrology;</hi> but 'tis cover'd with a Heap of Rubbiſh, Rules and Obſervations. And they that take moſt Pains, dig deepeſt, and make the Narroweſt Search into the Ruins of that Noble Science, ſhall for one genuine Pearl, find a Thouſand Counterfeits; for one Truth, a Thouſand Errors. It fares with <hi>Aſtro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logy,</hi> as it does with <hi>Religion;</hi> which is Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonized into Innumerable Sects and Facti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; each poſitively aſſerting, that they have the only Incorrupt <hi>Laws</hi> of <hi>God:</hi> Whereas, if you make a Strict Scrutiny, you ſhall find a very little Sincere Piety, but Abundance of Prophaneneſs, Hypocriſy, and Superſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
                  <p>Well, let it be how it will, whether the Stars have any Hand in the Plot of Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Events or no; whether <hi>Saturn</hi> or <hi>Mars</hi> be Malevolent or Benign Planets, it matters not much: No more does it to hear what they prate of all the Various Aſpects and
<pb n="333" facs="tcp:102965:179"/>Configurations of the other Stars. This I am ſure of, That I endure a great many Pains; which, let them be deriv'd from Above or Below, are very troubleſome.</p>
                  <p>'Tis poſſible, that all, or moſt Diſtempers which afflict Human Bodies in ſo many dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent Kinds, may be but the Effects of One Original Indiſpoſition, or Artaxy, in our Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal Spirits; or ſome Hereditary Contagion in our Blood, or Seminal Peſts in our Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours; which <hi>Proteus</hi>-like, appears in diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent Forms; Maſquerading it up and down our Bodies in the Diſguiſe of Fevers, Agues, Phthiſicks, Coughs, Conſumptions, Rheuma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſms, Pleuriſies, and a Thouſand more. Or, perhaps our Vitals are not ſound: Some Fall, or Knock, or other Accident in our Infan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, might put us out of Frame: Or the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baucheries of Youth may leave their Sting behind them, to chaſtiſe our Riper Years, and teach us Wiſdom before it is too late.</p>
                  <p>I tell thee in ſhort; all my Maladies, as I conjecture, owe their Original to an Ill<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temper'd Spleen, and Vitiated <hi>Hypocondria.</hi> This, as I ſaid before, I can eaſily feel with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in my ſelf, but can hardly expreſs the Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner how it comes to paſs, with that Accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racy as is requiſite to make another ſenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of it: Only in General Terms, I ſuppoſe it has made me extremely Melancholy at ſome Times; and as exceſſively Merry and Frolikſom at others; Both which Paſſions, thou know'ſt, have an ill Influence on the Heart, Midriff, Pericardium, Liver, and Lungs.
<pb n="334" facs="tcp:102965:180"/>This I have found by frequent and long Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience, though I will not undertake to deſcribe the Mechanick Operation of theſe Contiguous Vitals one upon another: Eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially to thee, who art the moſt Accompliſh'd and Gurious Anatomiſt of this Age. Suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice it to ſay, that I have perceiv'd with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in my ſelf, the Violent and Forcible Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traction or Dilatation, Heating or Cooling of any of theſe Interiour Principal Parts; to be very pernicious to my Health; ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving an immediate Influx on all the Reſt, and ſo on the Blood, wherein is contain'd the very Eſſence of this Mortal Life.</p>
                  <p>My Dear <hi>Phyſician,</hi> Our Bodies are per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect Machines, and ſubject to the like Miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chances. If but a Straw, a Pin, or any ſuch Diminutive Triffle, get between the Wheels of a Watch, 'tis preſently diſordered in its Motion. The whole Frame of the Artifici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al <hi>Mechaniſm,</hi> is either at a Stand, or goes too ſlow, or faſt; or at leaſt, very uneven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. So the Smalleſt Irregular Paſſion, in any of the Chief Members of our Bodies, diſturbs and violates the Peace of all the Reſt; it ſpoils their Harmony, and makes them jarr; juſt like a Viol, when ſome blun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering Hand has new-turn'd the Pegs, after a skilful Muſician had put the Inſtrument in Tune.</p>
                  <p>Beſides, there is a ſtrange Chain of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequences without. Our Paſſions hurt not our ſelves only, but others; and we receive again the Revenge of the Damage we gave.
<pb n="335" facs="tcp:102965:180"/>For, there is an Eternal Circulation of Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice in the World. The Whole <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſe</hi> is but a Piece of <hi>Clock-Work,</hi> where one Motion begets Another to Infinity, and one Stop in the Meaneſt Wheel would put all the Reſt to an equal Stand. We Mortals are <hi>Parts</hi> of this <hi>Grand Mechaniſm;</hi> and have our Parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Shares in the Diſaſters that happen to the <hi>Whole.</hi> I, for my Part, by many caſual Jolts of Misfortune; the deſigned Bruiſes of Enemies, and the corroding Teeth of Time am almoſt worn our: If thou wilt by thy Skill reſtore me again, and put me in Frame, the Praiſe will be thy own: Otherwiſe, the Firſt <hi>Artiſt</hi> muſt even take me to Pieces, diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolve this Uſeleſs Maſs; and when I am thus reduc'd to my Original Element, he may new-mold my Ductile Subſtance, and ham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer it to what Faſhion and End he pleaſes.</p>
                  <p>Only I beg of him, rather to make me any <hi>Four-Footed Beaſt,</hi> than a <hi>Spaniard,</hi> a <hi>Dutchman,</hi> or a <hi>Jew,</hi> among Men: For theſe are the Scandals of Human Race.</p>

                  <p>I Have had to do lately with Men pretend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to <hi>Aſtrology:</hi> Perſons of many Words and oſtentous Expreſſions, but of little Senſe, and leſs Knowledge, even in the very Sci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence they boaſt of. I can compare them to none more properly, than to thoſe Travellers, who viſit Foreign Countries, that they may come home laden with <hi>Romances</hi> and <hi>Fables;</hi> with Trifling Remarks and Jejune Obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, to make a crackling Noiſe among the Vulgar; whilſt Wiſe Men laugh at their Fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, in that after all their Extravagant Ram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles Abroad, they are not able to give a Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional Account of any Thing to the purpoſe; and are perfectly Strangers to the Place of their own Nativity. So theſe pretended <hi>Star-Gazers,</hi> whilſt they boaſt of being fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liarly acquainted with all the Regions of the Sky; can draw Maps, Charts, and Figures of the Remote Heavens, delineate the <hi>Houſes</hi> of the <hi>Zodiack,</hi> the Courſe of the <hi>Signs,</hi> the Governments, Laws, and Influences of the <hi>Planets</hi> and <hi>Conſtellations;</hi> are ignorant of their own Domeſtick Region, this <hi>Globe</hi> whereon they dwell. They know not the
<pb n="337" facs="tcp:102965:181"/>Things with which they are dayly conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant; much leſs can they penetrate into the Secrets of the Earth, or diſcover the Things that are under their Feet.</p>
                  <p>Wherefore turning my Back on theſe vain <hi>Scioliſts,</hi> I approach with Reverence to Thee, who art accompliſh'd in the Myſteries of <hi>thoſe</hi> Worlds Above, and <hi>this</hi> below. I have two Difficulties upon my Mind, which I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeech thee to ſolve. The firſt is concerning the Original of the <hi>Blacks</hi> or <hi>Negroes;</hi> the other about the <hi>Flux</hi> and <hi>Reflux</hi> of the <hi>Sea.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I was in Company not long ago with an Eminent <hi>Phyſician</hi> of <hi>Paris,</hi> a Perſon of great Abilities, a Searching Spirit, and very Curi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous in his Natural Obſervations. Among other Subjects which we diſcours'd of, we fell at length upon the Grand Diviſion of Mankind into <hi>Blacks</hi> and <hi>Whites.</hi> Which carried us ſo far, as to enquire into the Cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes of this Difference in their <hi>Colour;</hi> whether it proceeded from the Various Heat and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence of the Sun, or from the Divers Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities of the Climates wherein they live; or finally, from ſome Specifick Properties in themſelves, in the Natural Frame and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution of their Bodies.</p>
                  <p>He was of Opinion, That if <hi>Adam</hi> were <hi>White,</hi> all his Children muſt be ſo too; if <hi>Black,</hi> all his Poſterity muſt be of the ſame <hi>Colour.</hi> Therefore, by Conſequence, either the <hi>Blacks</hi> or the <hi>Whites</hi> are not the Deſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents of <hi>Adam.</hi> This he endeavoured to prove by many plauſible Arguments; but he
<pb n="338" facs="tcp:102965:182"/>inſiſted chiefly on one Experiment he had ſeen made, when preſent at the Diſſection of a dead <hi>Negro.</hi> For he affirm'd, That between the Outward and Inward Skin of the <hi>Corps,</hi> was found a Kind of <hi>Vaſcular Plexus,</hi> ſpread over the whole Body like a Web or Net, which was fill'd with a Juice as Black as Ink; from whence he concluded, the Outward Skin receiv'd its Tincture. And in regard there is no ſuch Web or Net to be found under the Skin of a <hi>White</hi> Man, it ſerv'd to him as an Argument, That they were Two different <hi>Species</hi> or Races of Men, from the very Firſt Original of Mortals; Nature ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving given the One Kind an Inward as well as an Outward Characteriſtick to diſtinguiſh them from the Other, in this diverſe Orga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nization of their Bodies.</p>
                  <p>I muſt confeſs, it has been my Opinion a long Time, That the <hi>Negroes</hi> or <hi>Blacks,</hi> owe their <hi>Colour</hi> to a far higher and more ancient Original, than to the <hi>Curſe</hi> which <hi>Noah</hi> pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced on <hi>Cham</hi> and all his Poſterity, as is commonly believed. And I cou'd even grant them to be of a different <hi>Race</hi> from that of <hi>Adam:</hi> For it is no new Thing with me, to conceive, That Mankind had a different Ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal from that which is Recorded in the <hi>Book</hi> that goes under <hi>Moſes</hi>'s Name. And I dare be bold to ſay, That that <hi>Book</hi> [of <hi>Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſis</hi>] was either not penn'd by <hi>Moſes;</hi> or if it were, that it has been much corrupted in After-Times; and that at preſent there is not any known True Copy of it in the World.
<pb n="339" facs="tcp:102965:182"/>For how can we Father ſo many Incongrui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, as are to be found in that <hi>Book,</hi> on the <hi>Holy Prophet?</hi> Or if he were really the Author of ſuch Contradictions and Abſurdities, how can we believe him, without forfeiting our Senſe. <hi>God</hi> gave us our Reaſon to be a Lamp and a Prop, to light and ſupport us as we walk through the Dark and Uncertain Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſs of this Mortal Life; not as an <hi>Ignis Fatuus</hi> to miſguide us, or a Reed of <hi>Egypt,</hi> which deceives him that leans on it, and cauſes him to fall. He has ſquar'd our Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties to the Works of <hi>Eternity.</hi> Our Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive <hi>Idea</hi>'s of Things are exact and true, till adulterated by the falſe Strokes of Education, Superſtition, and Foreign Error. Thus in my Infancy, I remember, I cou'd not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive any Limits to the Extent of Space, not any Beginning to the Age of the World. And I have retained the ſame Notion of Infinite and Eternal Matter ever ſince, even to theſe Grey Hairs. So of the Original of Mankind, I believe not the narrow and partial <hi>Genealo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gies</hi> of the <hi>Jews,</hi> who only ſtrove to exalt themſelves and their own <hi>Lineage</hi> above all the Nations on Earth beſides,</p>
                  <p>For ought I know, there were as many Original <hi>Protoplaſts</hi> of Mortals, as there are different Nations, ſpeaking various Radical and Maternal Languages; obeying ſeveral Forms of Government, and practiſing diſtinct <hi>Maxims</hi> and <hi>Principles.</hi> Or, it is poſſible, the <hi>Eaſt</hi> produced One ſort of Men, the <hi>Weſt</hi> Another; whilſt the <hi>North</hi> and the <hi>South</hi>
                     <pb n="340" facs="tcp:102965:183"/>brought forth an equal Variety. Who knows the Force of the <hi>Conſtellations</hi> and <hi>Heavens</hi> Above; or the hidden Virtues which exhale from the <hi>Depths</hi> Below? Theſe may differ as the <hi>Climates</hi> do: And the firſt <hi>Indigence</hi> of the <hi>Earth,</hi> might all be mark'd with the Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Affections, Paſſions and Diſpoſitions of <hi>Her</hi> their Common <hi>Parent;</hi> even as Children are now-a-days ſtigmatiz'd with the Luſt of a teeming Mother.</p>
                  <p>Oh that it were poſſible with <hi>Theſeus</hi> to deſcend into the Bowels of this <hi>Globe,</hi> and come up alive and ſafe again! That we might dive into the <hi>Abyſſes</hi> below, and viſit the Caverns of perpetual Darkneſs! That we might creep along by the Roots of the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Mountains, or through the Channels of Mines, a Thouſand Miles beneath the Sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face! There wou'd I ſeek for the Fountains of hidden Waters, which run to and fro in the Veins of the Earth; I wou'd find out the Subterranean Seas, Lakes, and Rivers, which feed our Upper Ocean with its Briny Floods. And perhaps there I ſhou'd diſcover the True Cauſe of the <hi>Flux</hi> and <hi>Reflux</hi> of the <hi>Sea,</hi> which has ſo puzzl'd all <hi>Philoſophy.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Tell me, Thou Sage of Sages, Can all the Fountains, Rivulets, mighty Channels, Lakes and <hi>Seas,</hi> which we ſee on the <hi>Superficies,</hi> be conſtantly ſupply'd only by Showers from Heaven, which in ſome Places fall very ſpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ringly or not at all? Cou'd the conſtant Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular Tides and <hi>Ebbs</hi> be ſtill maintain'd by the uncertain fickle Rains and Snows? Or
<pb n="341" facs="tcp:102965:183"/>is there not an Eternal Circulation of Waters thro' the various Hollowneſſes of the Earth?</p>
                  <p>In a Mine at <hi>Bern</hi> in <hi>Switzerland,</hi> about 230 Years ago, there was found a whole Ship 50 Fathom deep, with all its Tackle, and the dead Bodies of many Sea-Men: I ask, How that Ship came there?</p>
                  <p>Who can give me an Account of the many Whirl-Pools, <hi>Vorago's</hi> and <hi>Charybdis's,</hi> there are in divers Seas? There is one in the North of the World, not far from <hi>Moſcovy,</hi> Forty Miles in Compaſs, which when the <hi>Tide</hi> comes in, ſwallows up all the Sea with an inſupportable Noiſe, above that of Thun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, with Ships, Fiſh, and whatſoever elſe comes within that Fatal Stream; then at the <hi>Ebb</hi> it throws them up again with equal Fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry. Doubtleſs, there are innumerable ſuch Devouring Jaws of the Earth, under the va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Bottoms of the Sea. And I will never trouble my ſelf any farther for the Solution of this Grand Scruple, which coſt the <hi>Stagy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rite</hi> his Life.</p>
                  <p>Venerable <hi>Sage,</hi> Tell me thy Opinion of theſe Things; for I could bring Inſtances enough to write a Volume on this Subject. But I am brief with thee, who canſt not im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove by any Thing I can ſay; who write this as one that begs Inſtruction, and not to teach or inform an <hi>Oracle.</hi>

                  <p>HERE'S a Race of <hi>Infidels</hi> newly ſtarted in <hi>France;</hi> who, if they be let alone, may, for ought I know, in Time depopu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late not only this Kingdom, but the whole Earth. A Society of Miſcreants, Sorcerers, Magicians, Witches, and I know not what. They ſecretly ſteal Children away from their Parents, and offer them in Sacrifice to <hi>Dae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons.</hi> Their Blood they ſave to compound horrible Poiſons and execrable Enchantments. The Bread of <hi>Paris</hi> and other Cities, is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come like the Fruit of the Tree <hi>Zacon,</hi> which overſhadows the Center of <hi>Hell;</hi> full of dead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Venom.

Men chuſe to periſh by Hunger or Thirſt, rather than taſte the very Fruits of the Earth. They undergo a Voluntary Famine in the midſt of Infinite Plenty. And whilſt there is an Affluence of all things, which uſe to ſupport our Mortal Life, Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple complain of Scarcity, and die for Want of wholeſome Food.</p>
                  <p>In the mean While, no Body can tell the meaning of it; but a diligent Enquiry is

                  <p>This is a great Encouragement to the young <hi>Gentry</hi> and <hi>Nobles,</hi> and fills 'em with Glorious Emulations, every one being ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious to excel another in theſe Heroick Arts.

In a Word, I am afraid, leſt ſome prying buſy-Body has got a Glimpſe of our Secret Buſineſs, and mutual Intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence, and ſo put this Trick upon me in thy Name, to ſee what Anſwer I will make; which they may think eaſie to do, by inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepting the Letters which are addreſs'd to thee by the Poſt. To prevent which, I ſend this by a Private Meſſenger. We cannot be too cautious in ſuch Caſes; where one falſe Step betrays all, and lays our Deſigns open to the World.</p>

And I know not where they cou'd have pitch'd upon a more likely Man than <hi>Count Tecli:</hi> He comes of a good Parentage, and his Anceſtors were all along Patriots, and Sticklers for their Country Liberties.

                     <hi>To the</hi> Kaimacham.</head>
                  <p>I Shall now acquaint thee with an Accident, which extremely ſurpriz'd me, when I firſt heard of it, and has ſtill left me in Confuſion. About Seven Weeks are paſt ſince I receiv'd a Letter, dated as from <hi>Vienna;</hi> which <hi>Nathan Ben Saddi</hi> ſubſcrib'd, but I preſently perceiv'd it was not his own Hand-writing; which made me very uneaſie and full of Careful Thoughts. For, it contain'd Matters of Importance, Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crets of the <hi>Hungarian</hi> League, with a Parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Project relating to <hi>Count Tecli,</hi> a great Lord in that Country.</p>
                  <p>I conſider'd, that if the Letter were writ with <hi>Nathan</hi>'s Knowledg, and by his Order; he cou'd not be ſo forgetful, as not to bid the <hi>Scribe,</hi> whoever he was, give me an Account of the Reaſons which hindred him from Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting to me himſelf. For, he muſt needs ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine,
<pb n="353" facs="tcp:102965:189"/>I ſhou'd be troubled, and in no ſmall Aſtoniſhment, to find Matters of that dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous Conſequence, addreſſed to me in an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known Hand, under his Name. Or elſe I thought, he took me for a Man that made no Reflections on things. I knew not well what to conclude, amidſt ſo many probable Uncertainties.</p>
                  <p>However, I was reſolv'd to act more ſecure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and with greater Caution on my Side, in Order to a Right Information in this Myſtery. Wherefore, not daring to truſt the Poſts, I diſpatch'd away a Private <hi>Courier</hi> to <hi>Vienna,</hi> One in whom I can confide, with ample In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructions, and a Letter to <hi>Nathan Ben Saddi:</hi> Wherein, among other Things, I deſir'd him to tell me the Meaning of this Conduct.</p>
                  <p>My Meſſenger is honeſtly and ſafely return<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed again to <hi>Paris,</hi> but no <hi>Nathan Ben Saddi</hi> to be heard of. All the Account he cou'd learn of him, was, that about Eight: Weeks ago he went out of his Houſe, with a Stranger, who pretended Buſineſs with him at the <hi>Burſe</hi> or <hi>Exchange:</hi> But neither he nor the Stranger have been ſeen or heard of ſince; only they ſaid, that a Day or Two after <hi>Nathan</hi> was miſſing, there was the Dead Body of a Man ſeen floating in an Eddy of the <hi>Danube,</hi> hard by the Bridge; but the Face was ſo mangled and disfigured with Wounds and Slaſhes, that it was impoſſible for any to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſh, or diſcern who it was. Yet, <hi>Nathan</hi>'s Friends were apt to ſuſpect it was he himſelf,
<pb n="354" facs="tcp:102965:190"/>and that he had been privately murder'd and afterwards thrown into the River.</p>
                  <p>This is the Subſtance of what my Meſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger cou'd learn of him: And he was forc'd to uſe Abundance of Caution in Enquiring ſo far; leſt by being leſs reſerv'd, he might have brought himſelf into Trouble, run the Hazard of being put to the Torture, and diſcovering what I entruſted him with, beſides other In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conveniencies.</p>
                  <p>Praiſe be to <hi>God,</hi> he eſcaped all Scrutiny, and is come back ſafe with my Letter. But what is become of that <hi>Jew, God</hi> knows. Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps ſome of his own Nation have made him away privately, to prevent his turning <hi>Muſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſulman:</hi> For, he was unſettled in his Religion; and if amidſt his waverings, he ſeem'd to have any Particular Byaſs ſtronger than Ordinary, it was that which inclin'd him to the Faith of <hi>True Believers.</hi> And if he periſh'd on this Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count, we ought to eſteem him as a Martyr of <hi>God</hi> and his <hi>Prophet.</hi> But, I muſt confeſs, I that well knew the Shallowneſs and Incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtancy of <hi>Nathan</hi>'s Temper, with the Super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitious <hi>Attach</hi> which he ever had for his <hi>Rab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bi's,</hi> have hardly Faith or Charity enough to believe, his Zeal for the <hi>Alcoran</hi> would carry him to Martyrdom. Neither can I forbear thinking, there is ſomething worſe in it.</p>
                  <p>But all this which ſeems ſo ſtrange to me, may be well known to the Miniſters of the <hi>Auguſt Port,</hi> by whoſe Order perhaps he has receiv'd a Secret Death, as a Chaſtiſement of ſome Crimes they have found him guilty of;
<pb n="355" facs="tcp:102965:190"/>and which they cou'd not inflict openly in a Country of Enemies and <hi>Infidels</hi> Or, it may be, he has privately withdrawn himſelf, to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent ſuch a Puniſhment; being conſcious that he deſerv'd it. Be it how it pleaſes <hi>God,</hi> and my Superiours, I humbly crave Advice and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructions about the Ordering my Bills and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Matters. <hi>Sage Kaimacham,</hi> Adieu.</p>

And if ſo, I may ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect to be ſerv'd ſo my ſelf in a little Time. For my Turn is next.</p>
                  <p>Therefore, if thou haſt any Love or Friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip for me, be watchful on my Behalf: At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend the Whiſpers of the Court, and obſerve the Language of thoſe who diſcourſe with their Fingers Ends. The Caſt of the Eye many Times diſcovers the Secret Sentiments of the Heart: So does a Shrug of the Shoulder, a Pout of the Lip, or any other Artificial Geſture. They are all Significant and expreſſive of what Affections and Thoughts we harbour within. Thou know'ſt how to act the Mute upon Oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion, as well as any in the <hi>Seraill'.</hi> I conjure thee to uſe great Dexterity, and no leſs Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition in unravelling this Secret. Feign to know ſomething more than thou doſt, that ſo thou may'ſt really learn what I wou'd have thee know concerning <hi>Nathan</hi>'s Fate, and mine too, if poſſible. Let no cold Indifference make thee neglect this due Care of thy Friend's Intereſt and Life. We were born to ſerve one another with mutual Zeal and Fidelity. The

But theſe Arguments are ſuperfluous; thou needeſt no Spurs to do a Generous Action. I know thou loveſt me and wilt be active at this Juncture on my Account.</p>
                  <p>In full and entire Confidence of this, I take my Repoſe under the Shadow of the <hi>Divine Mercy;</hi> begging of <hi>God,</hi> to afford thee a Shelter in Time of Peril; and that when thou and I have weather'd all the Tempeſts of this Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal Life, we may triumphantly enter the <hi>Port</hi> of <hi>Paradiſe,</hi> and enjoy one another in Eternal Felicity.</p>
